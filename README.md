# AnnoSUM-MI


### This repository contains the AnnoSUM-MI Dataset, Summaries of Motivational Interviewing (MI) generated by the Large Language Models (LLMs), Prompts, and Results, and it is structured as follows:



### Dataset
This folder contains the following files:
* `train_dataset_MI_sessions.csv`: This file contains the original MI dialogues of the training dataset.
* `test_dataset._MI_sessions.csv`: This file contains the original MI dialogues of the training dataset.
* `train_data_MI_annotated.csv`: This file contains the annotated MI dialogues across six components of MITI.
* `test_data_MI_annotated.csv`: This file contains the annotated MI dialogues across six components of MITI.
* `chatgpt_summaries.csv`: This file contains the summaries generated by ChatGPT and the corresponding expert annotation across six components of MITI. 
* `Gemini_summaries.csv`: This file contains the summaries generated by Gemini and the corresponding expert annotation across six components of MITI.
* `DeepSeek_summaries.csv`: This file contains the summaries generated by DeepSeek and the corresponding expert annotation across six components of MITI.

### Models
The LLMs used for the experiments : 
```
OpenAIChatGPT (4.0)
DeepSeek (V3 )
Google Gemini (2.0 Flash)
```

### Supplementary Material
* `Prompts_Sum`: This file contains a variety of prompts (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot) used to generate the summaries of MI sessions.
* `Prompts_Anno`: This file contains the prompts used in one-shot and few-shot context settings to perform LLM-based annotation of MI summaries.
