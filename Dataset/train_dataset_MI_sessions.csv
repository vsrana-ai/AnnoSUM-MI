3;high;diet and weight loss management;0;client;;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;1;therapist;Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?;reflection;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;2;client;I-I-I feel fine.;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;3;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;4;client;I mean, my-my work is really man-manual labor-intensive so I'm usually working out in-in the hot sun the majority of the day, so I'm usually sweating out any like bad things I put in my system, so‚Äî;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;5;therapist;Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?;question;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;6;client;Well, a little bit, but nothing too-- you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything.;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;7;therapist;Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?;question;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;Well, yeah, I've been to the doctor about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be fine, so‚Äî;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;Okay. But you feel that you feel good?;question;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?;reflection;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a little bit better about your situation.;;neutral;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?;question;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;14;client;Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33];;neutral;;

4;high;managing life;5;client;Oh, oh, yeah, the‚ÄîYeah;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;6;therapist;You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?;question;;;
4;high;managing life;7;client;About a month.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;8;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;10;therapist;What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?;question;;;
4;high;managing life;11;client;Um, I don't know. I just felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind of nice to stand out a bit, I guess.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;12;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;13;client;Yeah, change.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;14;therapist;Yeah, and it looks nice.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;15;client;Thanks.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;16;therapist;Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?;question;;;
4;high;managing life;17;client;I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty good teeth. I don't know.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;19;client;I don't really know [unintelligible 00:01:04];;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;20;therapist;You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-;other;;;
4;high;managing life;21;client;[laughs] Thanks.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;22;therapist;every time you come in.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;24;therapist;Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.;therapist_input;;;
4;high;managing life;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;26;therapist;Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-;therapist_input;;;
4;high;managing life;27;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;28;therapist;just from contact with it. I wonder What are your thoughts about that?;question;;;
4;high;managing life;29;client;Well, I definitely don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-;;change;;
4;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yes, flossing.;reflection;;;
4;high;managing life;31;client;Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping.;;change;;
4;high;managing life;32;therapist;There's nothing yet.;reflection;;;
4;high;managing life;33;client;I guess I'm not paying attention to it.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;34;therapist;Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.;reflection;;;
4;high;managing life;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;36;therapist;"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?""";question;;;
4;high;managing life;37;client;I don't know, I guess if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem, then I might.;;change;;
4;high;managing life;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;39;client;But for now-- I mean, I just got and-;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;40;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;41;client;and it looks pretty cool.;;sustain;;
4;high;managing life;42;therapist;I guess that it does.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;44;therapist;Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-;therapist_input;;;
4;high;managing life;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;46;therapist;-really watch-;therapist_input;;;
4;high;managing life;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;48;therapist;the effect? Okay.;therapist_input;;;
4;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah. I guess if I really start to see a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-;;change;;
4;high;managing life;50;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
4;high;managing life;51;client;-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30];;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;52;therapist;Emily, you said it so well it-;other;;;
4;high;managing life;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;54;therapist;-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-;reflection;;;
4;high;managing life;55;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;56;therapist;-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-;other;;;
4;high;managing life;57;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
4;high;managing life;58;therapist;-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-;other;;;
6;high;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today.;other;;;
6;high;asthma management;1;client;No problem.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;2;therapist;I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.;therapist_input;;;
6;high;asthma management;3;client;Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here though.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;4;therapist;So you made it in here-;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;6;therapist;- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?;question;;;
6;high;asthma management;7;client;I don't know, something about changing my life even more. You know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do.;;sustain;;
6;high;asthma management;8;therapist;So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;9;client;Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My wife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. And I'm the only person that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that are going on in my life.;;sustain;;
6;high;asthma management;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. Almost‚Äî;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;11;client;Yeah, it's a lot.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;12;therapist;Almost overwhelming it sounds like.;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;13;client;Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. It is.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;14;therapist;Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?;question;;;
6;high;asthma management;15;client;Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;16;therapist;Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.;therapist_input;;;
6;high;asthma management;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;18;therapist;So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them.;question;;;
6;high;asthma management;19;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;20;therapist;It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.;other;;;
6;high;asthma management;21;client;Okay. Um, okay, that sounds good. As long as I'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting, um, I guess, pen to paper or something.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;22;therapist;Yep.;other;;;
6;high;asthma management;23;client;Um, okay, so my asthma.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;24;therapist;Okay, so asthma is one.;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;26;therapist;What else?;question;;;
6;high;asthma management;27;client;Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog.;;sustain;;
6;high;asthma management;28;therapist;So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's‚Äî;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;29;client;Well, he's-- Yeah, he's saying it's a main-- It's a main contributor to my asthma problems.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;30;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
6;high;asthma management;31;client;Which I don't- I don't- I don't- I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, but it's something that's there.;;sustain;;
6;high;asthma management;32;therapist;That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;33;client;Yeah. The dog has been there before my wife. I know I've had him longer.;;sustain;;
6;high;asthma management;34;therapist;Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;35;client;Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess, cutting down these last cigarettes I've been working on.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;36;therapist;Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?;therapist_input;;;
6;high;asthma management;37;client;Um, finances is a problem right now too.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;38;therapist;Okay, so money.;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;39;client;Time, I got to come to all these appointments and I'm taking time off work, which obviously is the money factor, right?;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;40;therapist;Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time.;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;41;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;42;therapist;Um, and some of these things are kind of related to each other I think we're already seeing.;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;43;client;Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on. And, um, also my drinking, I got to cut down my drinking too.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;44;therapist;Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?;question;;;
6;high;asthma management;45;client;No. It's just overwhelming when you see them everything they're, you know?;;sustain;;
6;high;asthma management;46;therapist;Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?;question;;;
6;high;asthma management;47;client;I think- I think the thoughts about the dog has been definitely bothering me, that's been one.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;48;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
6;high;asthma management;49;client;And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two.;;change;;
6;high;asthma management;50;therapist;Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-;reflection;;;
6;high;asthma management;51;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
6;high;asthma management;52;therapist; sounds like. Okay.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Um, it's really stupid. Uh, I was at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. You have a few drinks and then I thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are, yeah, they're in front of me. So I just like jumped off the stairs of the bus and I was wearing these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s-themed pub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell on my ankle. It was really embarrassing.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Sounds like a wild night.;reflection;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;It was a lot of fun but I didn't do any dancing after that.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like vodka 'cause I'm still, ugh, a little‚Äî;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;You're still feeling the effects of-;reflection;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;-last night, are you?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;A little bit.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Oh wow, it was-;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;really a rough night.;reflection;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Well, it's normal.;;sustain;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Um, well, me and my friends kinda, uh, we party on the weekend and, you know, we're all university students and so it's just normal, um, to have a few drinks.;;sustain;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;So a few drinks is nothing new to you?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;No.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight drinks like if I'm going hard. Um, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, so.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;No. I-I don't know. It's normal for university students I feel.;;sustain;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay, so at this point, you're not too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?;reflection;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah, sure.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;I don't know how you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick glance at this-;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.;therapist_input;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Oh really?;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Wow.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Uh, uh I would say a little over that.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay, okay.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Especially with midterms coming up.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?;reflection;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah. Yeah, I guess.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. Does that concern you at all?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, I mean, the 10 drinks seems like not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance.;;sustain;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;I guess I've kind of built it up over the years.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, so that's a little- a little bit, uh, concerning I guess to me.;;change;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Uh, any reason to? Uh, I guess health-health reasons.;;change;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Tell me more about that.;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Um, well, I mean, clearly I don't feel good right now. Um, and it's-- I definitely feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Uh, so I see a benefit.;;change;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-;reflection;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Yeah.;;change;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;-um, that you consume during the week?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Yeah;;change;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Is this something you would be willing to explore with me a little further at another time maybe when you're feeling a little bit better? Is this something you'd be willing to come back and talk to me about?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, yeah, I think when I'm feeling a little- a little better. Maybe when I haven't gone all out the-the night before and sprained my ankle.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-;therapist_input;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Okay, okay.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;kind of explore this a little bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. is that something that we could do?;question;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Sure. Yeah, just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles];;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;That's okay with me.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Thank you.;other;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Yeah. Sounds good.;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?;question;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my wife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so that's why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and‚Äî;;sustain;;
8;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? So-;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah, yeah. I'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit.;;sustain;;
8;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?;question;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-hand smoke and‚Äî;;change;;
8;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Yeah, I've got to read this. That's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? And she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now?;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;11;client;And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what I mean?;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?;question;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family. Like my dad's 85, he still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I thought of quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know if I can quit.;;change;;
8;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking.;;change;;
8;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned, like if this keeps going, like.;;change;;
8;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.;reflection;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;21;client;So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber?;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.;therapist_input;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I wish my wife could have come today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you.;other;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Okay. I'll have to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up.;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Okay. That sounds good.;other;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;27;client;All right.;;neutral;;
8;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Thanks for coming in.;other;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Okay. Thanks.;;neutral;;
10;low;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hi. You are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?;question;;;
10;low;diabetes management;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
10;low;diabetes management;2;therapist;Okay. Um, what brings you in?;question;;;
10;low;diabetes management;3;client;Well, I'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed.;;neutral;;
10;low;diabetes management;4;therapist;Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.;therapist_input;;;
10;low;diabetes management;5;client;Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is really serious stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive.;;neutral;;
10;low;diabetes management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.;therapist_input;;;
10;low;diabetes management;7;client;That's, uh, that's a huge amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I'm not certain I can do all that, and on top of it, it's-it's-- if I don't get it all done, all this stuff happens to me?;;neutral;;
10;low;diabetes management;8;therapist;So, it sure can.;therapist_input;;;
10;low;diabetes management;9;client;[sighs];;neutral;;
10;low;diabetes management;10;therapist;So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.;therapist_input;;;
10;low;diabetes management;11;client;Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35];;neutral;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;What else has brought you here?;other;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;They found a little bag of weed.;;neutral;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;It's not a lot though.;;sustain;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;It's not like I was gonna sell it or anything. It's like‚Äî;;sustain;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Just enough for your own use?;question;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Yeah, whatever, you know. It's California, no one cares.;;sustain;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.;other;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;How long is this gonna take?;;neutral;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?;therapist_input;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;I just wanna get whatever I need to get done, done.;;neutral;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?;reflection;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;Yeah;;neutral;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;.Okay, mm-hmm. Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Sarah, I'm so glad you came in for your well-woman exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. However, I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah, I guess.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah, um, normally, I'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?;reflection;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a little bit more.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to bed.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.;reflection;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;11;therapist;Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening.;other;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.;reflection;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Um, I mean, maybe I'll have like a drink or two.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Um, maybe like two max.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;19;client;I don't know. I mean, I don't really get why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here, you know, for a regular visit. I-I am not here to talk about my drinking.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Yeah, I guess.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah.;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, I-I'm just kinda surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low.;;sustain;;
12;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;So you're consciously trying to cut back.;reflection;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to stop smoking. Where do you see yourself on that scale?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Um, maybe like a five.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Well, I mean, you brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you know, cancer risk or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I don't want something to happen to me obviously.;;change;;
12;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit.;;change;;
12;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?;therapist_input;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day.;;change;;
12;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Yeah. Sure.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay, good. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some information on smoking cessation?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-;therapist_input;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;43;client;Well, what-what for exactly?;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.;therapist_input;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.;therapist_input;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;47;client;I mean, I would like to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole drinking thing.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?;question;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;49;client;I don't think so.;;neutral;;
12;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;Okay. Well, it's very nice to meet you. I'll see you in a month.;other;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;51;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.;therapist_input;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.;;sustain;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?;question;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Uh, yeah, well, I was just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their immune systems.;;sustain;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?;reflection;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Well, yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So.;;sustain;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?;question;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Uh, okay.;;neutral;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.;therapist_input;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I've never heard of polio.;;neutral;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Hmm. Some of these things I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?;question;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Uh, I guess it's okay. I mean, I just I want her to be healthy and safe.;;change;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.;reflection;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Yeah, I just want to do what's right.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-;reflection;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Yeah, I guess so.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.;reflection;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Yeah.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;"So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?";question;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Right now, I'm probably-;;neutral;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;gonna say a six.;;neutral;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;A six.;reflection;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.;;sustain;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.;reflection;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Right?;;neutral;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Okay?;question;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;I guess.;;neutral;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?;question;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not.;;neutral;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;And like be able to look nice, you know.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Okay, all right.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;I wanna be able to look nice.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?;question;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;I don't even really know-;;neutral;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;35;client;-like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;36;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;37;client;for years.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;38;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;39;client;Like, you can do it. Because like-;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;40;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;41;client;I know I can do it. Like I can do anything.;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;42;therapist;All right.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;43;client;I can do anything-;;change;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;44;therapist;All right.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;45;client;-I know that. But it's hard getting to the point where I-;;sustain;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;46;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;47;client;do something.;;sustain;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;48;therapist;All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?;question;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?;question;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Oh, it's a nice place. It's close to work. It's good living with a mate.;;neutral;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.;therapist_input;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;What's your thinking around that?;question;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;That's the thing, isn't it? I am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes.;;change;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;And Tristan is a good flatmate.;;sustain;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I have no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because I wanna change mine.;;change;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Right.;other;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;I just-- I don't know how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though.;;neutral;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay. You're good to explore, but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know about you changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?;question;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine.;;change;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;He doesn't have kids.;;neutral;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Right.;other;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate.;;neutral;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whƒÅna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?;question;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;The food would be good. Um, I get- I get support with-- my whƒÅnau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really good.;;neutral;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whƒÅnau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?;question;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with family, that they, even if their intentions are good-;;change;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back.;;change;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;So you're sick of this?;reflection;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.;;change;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.;;change;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;I want it.;;change;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.;reflection;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Yeah.;;change;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.;reflection;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.;;sustain;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;And, uh, and it's fun.;;sustain;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;And it's fun.;reflection;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;You know?;;neutral;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but‚Äî;;sustain;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.;therapist_input;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.;therapist_input;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.;;sustain;;
20;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.;;sustain;;
20;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.;;change;;
20;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.;;sustain;;
20;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?;question;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah, exactly.;;sustain;;
20;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;How were you successful when you quit before?;question;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;15;client;I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;17;client;"-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so.";;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;But they don't feel as scary to you now?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;21;client;No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.;;change;;
20;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;You're doing the best you can do.;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;25;client;"Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.";;change;;
20;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?;question;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.;;sustain;;
20;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?;question;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;31;client;I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.;;change;;
20;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?;reflection;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Where do you think we should go from here?;question;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;35;client;I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.;;change;;
20;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.;therapist_input;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;37;client;I don't like medicine.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.;therapist_input;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;39;client;That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.;question;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;41;client;That would be really nice.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.;therapist_input;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;43;client;I would like that. That would be great.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Great.;other;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
20;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Laura.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Hi.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.;therapist_input;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Does that sound okay?;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;

21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That's great.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Oh.;other;;;

21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;-something like that, yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;You like to have a good time?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends.;;neutral;;

21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Through college.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;

21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Great. So, being a good friend and-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;-having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too.;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Hm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;-in general, yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;-and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever ha;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Hm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Yeah just-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;client;kinda hold a drink.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;have one there and pretending to have it.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How-;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Um.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;often do you think that you are around alcohol.;question;;;

21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Not really much.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Okay. And what sort of situations are you in?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around-;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;Hm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;or something.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends.;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Pretty much, yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or-;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;Um‚Äî;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;or mostly just-just with the kids?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Mm-hmm. And, what about driving?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Um, like drunk driving?;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you‚Äî;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Yeah.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;-you're not putting yourself-;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;-in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that.;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;Not more than two drinks.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;Okay. So, the-the absolute most-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;-was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;117;client;Um, I've never really been drunk-;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;118;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;119;client;-so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;121;client;So.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;122;therapist;So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;123;client;Yeah, yeah, relaxed.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;124;therapist;Okay. Uh, anything else?;question;;;

21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;126;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;127;client;So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;128;therapist;Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;129;client;Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;130;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;131;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;132;therapist;-had some consequences-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;133;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;134;therapist;-and decided that's not for you?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;135;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;136;therapist;Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;137;client;Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just-;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;138;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;139;client;-very, like, obnoxious things.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;140;therapist;Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal-;therapist_input;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;141;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;142;therapist;-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life.;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;143;client;Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles];;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;144;therapist;Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're‚Äî;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;145;client;It's just there.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;146;therapist;It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;147;client;Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;148;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;149;client;-alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;150;therapist;Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;152;therapist;And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;153;client;I guess, I mean, since it's just there.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;154;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;155;client;So-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;156;therapist;Got it.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;157;client;it ties in with the whole belonging thing.;;sustain;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;158;therapist;Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;159;client;Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any-;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;160;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;161;client;-in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;162;therapist;Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;163;client;I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;164;therapist;Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;165;client;Yeah, definitely.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;166;therapist;Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;167;client;Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so-;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;168;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;169;client;-maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;170;therapist;Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;171;client;Yeah, definitely.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;172;therapist;your drinking eventually?;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;173;client;For sure.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;174;therapist;How might that go?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;175;client;Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;176;therapist;Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or‚Äî;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;177;client;Definitely, yeah. That's a good word.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;178;therapist;Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing.;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;179;client;Maybe a five or six.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;180;therapist;And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;181;client;Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;182;therapist;Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something.;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;183;client;Yeah, yeah. Definitely.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;184;therapist;Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;185;client;Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;186;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;187;client;I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;188;therapist;So, what number do you think you'd say?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;189;client;Um, on a scale of 1 to 10-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;190;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;191;client;if I can quit or not?;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;192;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;193;client;Maybe like an 8 or 9.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;194;therapist;Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;195;client;Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;196;therapist;Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;197;client;Yes.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;198;therapist;-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for t;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;199;client;Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;200;therapist;Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;201;client;Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;202;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;203;client;It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;204;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;205;client;"So, I could just tell them, ""Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.""";;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;206;therapist;What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;207;client;Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;208;therapist;Uh-huh. Anything else?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;209;client;Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;210;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;211;client;So, that would be one.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;212;therapist;Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes.;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;213;client;Yeah.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;214;therapist;Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;215;client;Yeah, that would be okay.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;216;therapist;All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;217;client;Yeah.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;218;therapist;-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;219;client;Right.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;220;therapist;Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;221;client;Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;222;therapist;Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-;therapist_input;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;223;client;Okay, yeah.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;224;therapist;-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things th;therapist_input;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;225;client;Oh okay.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;226;therapist;-without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-;therapist_input;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;227;client;Yeah, that's a good idea.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;228;therapist;-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;229;client;Yeah, for sure.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;230;therapist;Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to-;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;231;client;I mean-;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;232;therapist;to stop drinking.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;233;client;-I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;234;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;235;client;So.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;236;therapist;Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;237;client;Yeah. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;238;therapist;Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;239;client;No. No, I think I'm okay.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;240;therapist;Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-;reflection;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;241;client;Okay.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;242;therapist;-and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;243;client;Okay, great. Thanks.;;neutral;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;244;therapist;That sound okay?;question;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;245;client;Yeah.;;change;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;246;therapist;All right. Thanks so much.;other;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;247;client;No problem.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;0;therapist;You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a little bit more about that. Do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;1;client;Yes, um, my top value is family happiness, um, that's-;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;2;therapist;That's number one?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;3;client;-that's number one to me, especially now. I usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every two to three months-;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;5;client;-just to see if anything changed, and every time it has changed.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;6;therapist;Oh. So, right now family value is the most important thing to you?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;7;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;8;therapist;Family happiness?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;9;client;Yes, it's the most important because it's a little lacking, so I know that that's something that is very important to me.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;10;therapist;Okay. Would you like to talk more about that?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;11;client;Yeah. Um, I can just pretty much say that my family hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if-- I feel like if we all just can fall in the middle, which I know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, um, I think for my part, 'cause I can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members, and-and be able to voice what I feel as far as how important family happiness-happiness is to me.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;12;therapist;Mm. Because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you.;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;13;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;14;therapist;Is that what you're saying? Yes?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;16;therapist;And you want them to know?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;17;client;And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, like I said, every two to three months just to see where I am.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;18;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;19;client;And, um, these definitely are different from-;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;20;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;21;client;What I usually pick.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;22;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;23;client;"Um, and then the second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my family you kind of lose sight of your faith a little bit, which is normal. And not a lot of people-- They, uh-- Well, in my church home, i-it just seems like, ""Oh, you lost touch of God, oh my gosh, you're the devil.""";;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;24;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;25;client;You know? And it's kind of like, well we all face those challenges every day, we're not perfect, you know? And I feel like my faith is still there but it's-- You know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;26;therapist;Right. So, right now, it really is important to you to put the family values first? And religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a little bit?;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;27;client;Yeah. I lost faith, and so I'm not afraid to say it.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;28;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;

22;high;adhering to family values;32;therapist;So, you know it's normal.;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;33;client;I know that it's normal.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;34;therapist;But sometimes it's not something that people talk about.;reflection;;;

22;high;adhering to family values;97;client;-and, uh, I learned about the different way of looking at self-esteem.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;98;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;99;client;-and I've been definitely esteeming others.;;change;;
22;high;adhering to family values;100;therapist;Uh.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;101;client;So, I've had, um, less time to have some inner harmony.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;102;therapist;Oh yeah, right. The family has been so much coming first that you have sort of taken a back seat?;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;103;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;104;therapist;You're not even on-- Are you on the schedule at all? Meaning of time in a day dedicated? Is most of it going to your family?;question;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;105;client;Most of it goes to everything else, but me.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;106;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;107;client;And, uh, like, I don't even‚Äî;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;108;therapist;It's gonna be hard to achieve inner harmony-;therapist_input;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;110;therapist;-if you're always running around taking care of everybody.;therapist_input;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;111;client;And I feel like inner harmony first comes with sleep. [laughter] I haven't been able to sleep lately.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;112;therapist;Right.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;113;client;But, um-;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;114;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;115;client;-I think that's the first step, but I just, like-- Oh my gosh, I'm just overwhelmed, um, but I would like to gain that back, inner harmony, inner peace-;;change;;
22;high;adhering to family values;116;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;117;client;-because when I was, you know, 18 I was just so, like, free-spirited, open-minded. I was living life, now that I look at it, as a fairy tale.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;118;therapist;Mm. Mm-hmm.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;119;client;"And so I got knocked to reality and reality said, ""This is not a fairy tale."" Um, you're now on board. Like‚Äî";;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;120;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;121;client;"And so I felt like, ""This is not about you, you know, this is about everyone else.""";;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;122;therapist;Mm. So, something dramatic happened?;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;123;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;124;therapist;That kind of shocked you out of that fairy tale life-;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;125;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;126;therapist;and into a take care of everyone else thing?;reflection;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;127;client;Yeah-;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;128;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;129;client;-definitely, and the shock just keeps getting.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;130;therapist;Okay. Well, I really enjoyed having the time to be able to sit down and talk to you about your values. I hope that it's been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can support even any way in helping some of those other values get a little bit more attention, we can talk about that next time.;other;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;131;client;Thank you for listening.;;neutral;;
22;high;adhering to family values;132;therapist;Okay. All right? You're welcome.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;1;client;Hi.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;2;therapist;So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it kind of- it kind of started like five, six years ago.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;4;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;5;client;Um, it kind of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently moved out, um, from living with my parents. So just made it a bit worse, I think.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;6;therapist;Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah, I am- Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;8;therapist;Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;10;therapist;So how has that, uh, changed things for you?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;11;client;Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like have to do this. I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;12;therapist;Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;13;client;It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;14;therapist;Okay. So you'd, you're feeling a little bit anxious about today.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;16;therapist;Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;17;client;Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;18;therapist;Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;19;client;Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;21;client;Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;22;therapist;So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah. Um, yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;24;therapist;So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;26;therapist;So you would have been about 19.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;28;therapist;And what was happening around that time?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;29;client;Uh, I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;30;therapist;What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;31;client;I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with people that I don't know, I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do them, but just is scary. So I just don't do it.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;32;therapist;So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;33;client;Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;34;therapist;"Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?";reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;35;client;Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.;question;;;
23;high;managing life;37;client;Um, like a work situation or just--?;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;38;therapist;Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;39;client;Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that. And I guess- they asked me to, um‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;40;therapist;It's quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;41;client;Yeah. Yeah. It was a fashion thing. I think it was for some kind of-- I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;42;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but I find it- found it really hard to try and focus on that 'cause I was so- I was kind of feeling really anxious and‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;44;therapist;So it wasn't what you expected?;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;45;client;No. No.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;46;therapist;So how long ago was that?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;47;client;That was two weeks ago.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;48;therapist;Okay. So it was quite recent.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;50;therapist;So on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;51;client;I just felt really- just really kind of hot. I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out. And I was kind of trying really, really hard to just focus, and just, you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything, but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like, when they'd say 'action' and they're trying to get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;52;therapist;I can tell you're getting kind of anxious, even just thinking about that day.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;54;therapist;Okay. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you, you kind of got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;55;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;56;therapist;W-what was, do you mean you kind of try to hide behind it or?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;57;client;I was just trying to focus on it. I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly, it would just-- I don't know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;58;therapist;So you're holding the camera very tightly.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;60;therapist;W-why was that? Why was that helpful?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;61;client;Cause I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just-- I don't know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it. 'Cause my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads, like, and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see, and I just thought if I just managed to hold onto it, it wouldn't be as noticeable, but‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;62;therapist;Okay. So, okay. So it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you're worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind?;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;63;client;Just-- I was just, just stupid and it was just really-- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I-- Like- I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just, they could tell. And then just thinking of what was she doing?;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;64;therapist;They could tell what‚Äî;question;;;
23;high;managing life;65;client;I was just really like sweaty and just‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;66;therapist;Oh, it was all-all that they could see that-that was-;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;68;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
23;high;managing life;69;client;Yeah, um, I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell but, I mean, my hands, like, they were so shaken. I was really red and just was-- Just wishing that I just wasn't there.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;70;therapist;So, I mean, you've already described it to me a little bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, how'd-how'd you say, how'd you think you looked?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;71;client;I think just very stupid and, like, I think my face was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was probably sweating and shaking, like my hands were definitely really really shaking. Um, and af-- it was, like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely see.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;72;therapist;Okay and what-what did you do about-- How did you try and conceal that or hide that?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;73;client;Um, well, I again was trying to grip the camera, just look down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird anyway, but hopefully if-- I just- I just tried really hard to just focus and look down, not trying, like not kind-- look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on with it as best as I could, but‚Äî;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;74;therapist;So you avoided looking at people. It sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway.;reflection;;;
23;high;managing life;75;client;Yeah, no, I-I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I- I'll just be really sweaty and like, people would definitely be able to see, so.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;76;therapist;Okay and how did it end?;question;;;
23;high;managing life;77;client;Um, well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so, and then, um, people were going, um, just a-after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it. I'd just- I went home straight away, just got on my car and went home. I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted to get-get home straight away.;;neutral;;
23;high;managing life;78;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hey, can I help you?;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace has just gone smoke-free. I-I'm not-not very happy about it. I'm gonna keep smoking, but I was wondering if there's anything that-that can help me like get through the day. It's like, you know, go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So your workplaces went smoke-free and you're not too pleased, huh?;reflection;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;3;client;No. I'm not gonna quit smoking. I mean, I like it. It helps me relax. So, I mean, I don't see what the big deal is.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. Tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day. It'll help with the‚Äî;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;5;client;I mean, I smoke a little less than a pack a day. It's not too bad. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want to right now.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. So you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that.;reflection;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Sure. I can quit.;;change;;
24;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Okay. What makes you so confident?;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Well, I mean, I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that I do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit.;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;11;client;I am probably a two. I-I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, I- I'm totally not gonna quit smoking.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Okay. What made you say two instead of one?;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I mean, anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking?;;change;;
24;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke.;therapist_input;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Okay. Well, that‚Äôs good information. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I-I do have at least tools to help me.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I don't know. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, that would probably help too, but I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future.;;sustain;;
24;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work who planning to quit.;question;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;19;client;That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. That-that's a good idea. Yeah.;;change;;
24;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information today. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you.;therapist_input;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Okay. Well, thanks a lot.;;neutral;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Um, I really want to start working out again. Definitely wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be healthy.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Um, I'm sick of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want to have more energy.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Um, I don't like the way my clothes fit or don't fit me.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Just, I don't feel comfortable.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Yeah. So, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit.;reflection;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be good for you to kinda make this change?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Um, I know exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel good. I felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel good. I want to be a good example for my kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;-exercising. So, I want-- I really just want to go get back in a routine.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?;reflection;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Um, I don't know. I'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine.;reflection;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Right, yeah.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Mm, I would like to say a seven or an eight, that that's how important it is to me.;;neutral;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Because I'm really sick of being overweight.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Not ha-- I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your family.;reflection;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Exactly, yeah.;;neutral;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?;question;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for walks or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the house so that I know I can go there quickly or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways I can do it first.;;change;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;That's great. It sounds like you've got some options and leads on how- on how to get that done.;reflection;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;So what's been going on?;question;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;1;client;I just want my call, that's it.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;All right. yeah, I was told that you're phone calls was taken away;reflection;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;3;client;[scoffs] Yeah.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;What-what happened?;question;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;5;client;I don't know. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I don't- I don't know what it is. Something about me not making my bed, something about my attitude. I don't know, I just want my call, man.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;Okay. yeah, it was weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard.;reflection;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;7;client;I just wanna contact my mom, that's it.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?;reflection;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;9;client;My dad's birthday is tomorrow.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;11;client;And I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it.;;neutral;;
26;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?;reflection;;;
27;low;asthma management;0;therapist;I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control. So, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again.;therapist_input;;;
27;low;asthma management;1;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, I de-I definitely don't wanna come back here. But, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;2;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
27;low;asthma management;3;client;-ridiculous part is I've had him for 12 years before, and now it's a problem.;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;4;therapist;Well, you sound a bit surprised by that. But I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect.;therapist_input;;;
27;low;asthma management;5;client;Yeah, but I-- Um, let me just clarify, I've seen the materials, I have them-;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
27;low;asthma management;7;client;-I have even read them. All I've been doing is taking the medicine. So, I don't know that much about this.;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;8;therapist;Well, uh, wait a second, Sal, what do you mean you-you- ha- If you-- As in-- You know to be informed about-- I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby-;other;;;
27;low;asthma management;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;10;therapist;a new baby.;other;;;
27;low;asthma management;11;client;John Carlo, yeah.;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;12;therapist;-and you are very concerned about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps, you've-you've almost quit smoking-;reflection;;;
27;low;asthma management;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
27;low;asthma management;14;therapist;-which is fantastic. So, the next step is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's- so- It's gonna be hard to do that. But there are always people who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have friends or family members.;therapist_input;;;
27;low;asthma management;15;client;Uh, this is a little too much for me now. First of all, John Carlo is taken care of. That's fine. He doesn't have- no asthma from the dog. It's just me. I don't ha‚Äî;;sustain;;
27;low;asthma management;16;therapist;It's you that I'm worried about, Sal. It's you that I'm worried about, okay? The-the symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks. And-and do you appreciate how-- This is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough.;therapist_input;;;
27;low;asthma management;17;client;"So, Oscar is gonna make me die? He hasn't made me die in 12 years, and the doctor is saying, ""Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking."" So, what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die? I've had him for 12 years.";;sustain;;
27;low;asthma management;18;therapist;Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this.;therapist_input;;;
27;low;asthma management;19;client;Well, they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one, and I'll keep Oscar.;;sustain;;
27;low;asthma management;20;therapist;Sal, you're almost on the strongest one. And if Oscar is that important to you, then do you put Oscar higher than your baby, than your wife? Like, uh, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?;therapist_input;;;
27;low;asthma management;21;client;I understand, but I don't think you get my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years. So, I'm not just gonna up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing.;;sustain;;
27;low;asthma management;22;therapist;Uh, okay, well;other;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today.;other;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes?;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Oh I've been wanting to, for a long long time in years.;;change;;
28;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit.;question;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Well I have a 15-year-old daughter and she's highly against it. And, um, health issues, you know, I'm getting-- not getting any younger and I have asthma and I have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, I'm having a hard time breathing when I exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really.;;change;;
28;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony.;;change;;
28;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum-;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Right.;;change;;
28;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;-and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in-in turn, it's embarrassing for me.;;change;;
28;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah.;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Right right, yeah.;;change;;
28;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say‚Äî;reflection;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Tell me a little bit about what happened with the-the Chantix.;question;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Well, um, I don't know if it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from it so.;;sustain;;
28;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect‚Äî;question;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Oh really.

28;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Right and it didn't stop me from smoking as well, so that's, uh, [laughs]‚Äî;;sustain;;
28;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Want the good [crosstalk] no good right? And how long ago was that that you‚Äî;question;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Um, that was about two to three years ago.;;neutral;;
28;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay, all right.;other;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;43;client;I tried it a couple of times.;;sustain;;

28;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;55;client;No. Yeah.;;neutral;;
28;high;smoking cessation;56;therapist;Okay. So, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things.;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;57;client;And agitation really-;;sustain;;
28;high;smoking cessation;58;therapist;Oh yeah.;other;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;59;client;-because, um, you know, um, being at my age I'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far ;;sustain;;
28;high;smoking cessation;60;therapist;So, it's already piled I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse.;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;61;client;Right, exactly.;;sustain;;
28;high;smoking cessation;62;therapist;Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?;question;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;68;therapist;Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty good.;reflection;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;69;client;But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasn't able to smoke so, yeah.;;sustain;;

28;high;smoking cessation;98;therapist;You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different things. And, um, you might already know this, and so let me know if you do, um, because of the way cigarettes you're describing it and accurately is-- it is really what we call an almost perfect drug in a lot of ways.

28;high;smoking cessation;99;client;Oh, really?;;neutral;;
28;high;smoking cessation;100;therapist;-it will do whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it kinda get, it gets in the end with the health.;therapist_input;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;109;client;So, it's kind of like a double-edged sword.;;neutral;;

Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer.;therapist_input;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;11;client;$150, are you serious? I can't pay that. All right, I'm done with this. I'm over it.;;neutral;;

33;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Check it, yeah.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;check this out? What do you think?;question;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Oh, that was fixed really nice.;;neutral;;

33;high;smoking cessation;11;client;I like that.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;It went well. Good. Excellent. I did notice quite a lot of staining, actually. I'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that.;therapist_input;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Mm. Well, the usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;15;client;All of the above.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time?;question;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Yeah, I've thought about it. I'm just-- It's not my cup-- I-I-I hear it from everybody, and, uh, I've tried- I've tried before, didn't work. I get it all the time.;;sustain;;
33;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;"Okay. And it's like here I am one more person, the next- the next doctor who's saying, ""You need to quit smoking, David.""";therapist_input;;;

33;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Mm, and I'm sorry, that's not how I mean to come across at all.;therapist_input;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;21;client;"Yeah, I-I-I know I'm not an idiot and people know that smokers are, you know, ""How can you smoke today?"" [coughs] It's just not that easy to, uh, quit.";;sustain;;
33;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Mm-hmm, and if it was as easy as the doctor is saying or your partner-;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;

33;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Uh, who wouldn't be?;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;you have to quit.;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;27;client;You'd have to be a real fool not to do it-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;29;client;-if you [unintelligible 00:01:34] was gonna make it like that.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;31;client;I-I just hear it every day.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Yeah. And what's been your past experience with smoking? Tell me-- Can you tell me a little bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life, how long you've smoked?;question;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;33;client;I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;35;client;-and quit a couple of times, off and on in my 20s, but, you know, it's been consistent. And I can't see myself changing now.;;sustain;;
33;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;37;client;No matter what kinda talk I get or what they come up with.;;sustain;;
33;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;It sounds like almost you've tried a lot of things that are out there and it's not something that you're‚Äî;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Not gonna worked for me.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;

33;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;43;client;I know cold turkey is probably the only thing that's ever gonna do it to anybody that's done it. Mysel- My group, it's been cold turkey-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;45;client;-and then they fight it, but [sighs] it's my choice-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;47;client;-and I don't like lectures about it.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;Yeah. And it really is your choice. You're absolutely right-;therapist_input;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;"-that nobody has the right to tell you what to do. Um, can I ask? If you were to-- Uh, if there was to be a situation where you decided, ""I must quit,"" what-what would that situation be?";question;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;51;client;Hard to tell 'cause I already had open-heart surgery. That didn't do it.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;53;client;Prostate cancer, that didn't do it.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Right.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;55;client;I don't know. I really don't know. I just don't really want it.;;sustain;;
33;high;smoking cessation;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;57;client;I just-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;58;therapist;So, this is something that you-you-;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;59;client;-have to-;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;60;therapist;-pretty much see yourself doing for-;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;61;client;Yeah, a while, quite a while. Yeah.;;sustain;;
33;high;smoking cessation;62;therapist;Yeah. Okay. Well, I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it. And I get that right now, this is not something that you wanna pursue. Would it be okay if I brought it up in our next visit? 'Cause I-I know that you've said you don't want a lecture, but on the other hand, I am- I am concerned.;therapist_input;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;63;client;Okay, yeah. I could go for that. I-I, uh, I'm always open to some-- you know, to listen. Yeah.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;64;therapist;As long as I don't talk too much?;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;65;client;Yeah. [laughs];;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;66;therapist;Okay. [chuckles];other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;67;client;"[unintelligible 00:03:34] options. I had some-- I had my surgeon just go like, ""You're- you're--"" like, ""Why do I even keep you as a patient?""";;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;68;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;69;client;He's good, though. [laughs];;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;70;therapist;[chuckles] You're glad to keep him as a doctor?;reflection;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;72;therapist;Yeah. Well, and, David, honestly, wherever you're at, we'll work with it.;therapist_input;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;73;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;74;therapist;Um, and so thanks for- thanks for taking a couple of minutes and talking about smoking.;therapist_input;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;75;client;Thanks, doc.;;neutral;;
33;high;smoking cessation;76;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;77;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;"Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""";;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;-and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;-drinking and your friends are-;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;"Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.";;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.";reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;"Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.";;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just‚Äî;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;You care about them.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure‚Äî;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;I don‚Äôt want that.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;You don't want that.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;You want this baby.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Yeah.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;You don't wanna let your baby down.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;No.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?";reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;"You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.";reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.";reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""";reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there‚Äôs this new life ahead.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?";question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;"This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?";question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;"I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.";;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;A little bit.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;"It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?";question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;And I know that if they found out, they would be really pissed.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;I think so, yeah, like the telling my parents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my parents is probably the scariest thing.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;And having to talk to those friends, like right now I don't want to do that. It's- it puts them in a weird place.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;And you don't have equipment.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;It feels like I have to lec- I don't wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;You're concerned that they're gonna kind of treat you like a child.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;My parents or my friends?;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;Yeah, and I don't wanna be like that.;;sustain;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;You just wanna be like peers talking.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;And you want them to support you.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.;other;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Yeah, like if there's a- if there's a balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if there's a balance between that-;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my friends altogether.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it already too late?;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point.;therapist_input;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;Mm-hmm, I have to do.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?;question;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;I don't think so. I think just knowing that it's not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started.;;change;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;You kind of got a reality check today.;reflection;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;A little bit.;;neutral;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart.;other;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.;therapist_input;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.;;neutral;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today.;other;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Thanks for having me.;;neutral;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself.;question;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.;question;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?;;neutral;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?;question;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;I want to be more physically active than I've been.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?;question;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?;question;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.;reflection;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;change;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;Great.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;0;therapist;Barbara Roberts?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;1;client;Yes. Morning.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;2;therapist;Hello, there.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;3;client;Hello.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;4;therapist;My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;5;client;Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;6;therapist;Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;7;client;Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;8;therapist;Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;9;client;Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;10;therapist;All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;11;client;Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;12;therapist;All right. So, quite a few symptoms there-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;13;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;14;therapist;- and some of them sound-;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;15;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;16;therapist; quite troublesome to you.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;17;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;18;therapist;Okay. And how long has this been going on?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;19;client;Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;21;client;Yes. Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;22;therapist;Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;23;client;Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;25;client;Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;26;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;27;client;- for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;28;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;29;client;I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;30;therapist;Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;31;client;Hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;32;therapist;- the herbal shop-;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;33;client;Hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;34;therapist; how are you taking them?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;35;client;Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;36;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;37;client;- so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;38;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;39;client; other tablets for other things.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;40;therapist;So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;41;client;Hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;42;therapist;- what you're gonna take-;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;43;client;Hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;44;therapist;- depending on what your stomach's doing?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;46;therapist;Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;47;client;Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called?;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;48;therapist;A gastroscopy.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;49;client;That's it. Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;50;therapist;You got the tube down-down from the top?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;51;client;Yes. Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;52;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;53;client;Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;54;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;55;client;That was very uncomfortable.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;56;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;57;client;Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;58;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;59;client;-and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;60;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;61;client;- as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;62;therapist;Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;63;client;Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;64;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;65;client;- decided that I've had enough tests.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;66;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;67;client;And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;69;client;- there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;70;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;71;client;Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;72;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;73;client;I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;74;therapist;Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;75;client;No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;76;therapist;Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;77;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;78;therapist;You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;79;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;80;therapist;Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;81;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;82;therapist;- and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;83;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;84;therapist;Is that- is that about-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;85;client;I'd say so, yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;86;therapist; if I got the story right.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;87;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;88;therapist;Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;89;client;Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;90;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;91;client;I just couldn't sit all day comfortably.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;92;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;93;client;Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;94;therapist;Right. Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;95;client;Um, I miss that.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;96;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;97;client;I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;98;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;99;client;To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;100;therapist;Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;101;client;Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;102;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;103;client;Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;104;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;105;client;- that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;106;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;107;client;Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;108;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;109;client;That's another thing we don't do anymore now.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;110;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;111;client;Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;112;therapist;Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;113;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;114;therapist; quite a lot because of these symptoms.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;115;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;116;therapist;It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;117;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;118;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;119;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;120;therapist;So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;121;client;Well, I potter around the house-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;122;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;123;client;- um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say.;;neutral;;

36;high;changing approach to disease;131;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;132;therapist;Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;133;client;Um, well, last year, um, my son got married-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;134;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;135;client;- and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;136;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;137;client;That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;138;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;

36;high;changing approach to disease;143;client;That was a good time.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;144;therapist;Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;145;client;I hardly noticed them.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;146;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;147;client;Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;148;therapist;Right. Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;149;client;Which was good.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;150;therapist;Right. That's interesting.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;151;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;152;therapist;And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;153;client;Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;154;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;155;client;It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;156;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;157;client;- he travels with his job, and he-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;158;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;159;client; can be away a couple of times a month.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;160;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;161;client;Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;162;therapist;Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;163;client;Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;164;therapist;Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;165;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;166;therapist;What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;167;client;Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;168;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;169;client;You know, he's- he says it's stress.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;170;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;171;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;172;therapist;And what do you think?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;173;client;Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;174;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;175;client;- for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;176;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;177;client;Um‚Äî;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;178;therapist;And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;179;client;Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;180;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;181;client;- in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;182;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;183;client;"- other times I'll think, ""I wonder if it's an ulcer.""";;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;184;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;185;client;Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;186;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;187;client;Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;188;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;189;client;- the-the doctor didn't investigate.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;190;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;191;client;But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;192;therapist;Oh, dear.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;193;client; and it was- it was too late to operate then.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;194;therapist;Right. Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;195;client;So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;196;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;197;client;And, uh, yeah, I worry about that.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;198;therapist;So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night?;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;199;client;Oh, yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;200;therapist;To see if you can feel anything?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;201;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;202;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;203;client;I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know?;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;204;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;205;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;206;therapist;Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;207;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;208;therapist;You've-you've tried a variety of medications-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;209;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;210;therapist;- some prescribed, some-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;211;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;212;therapist;- from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;213;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;214;therapist;- but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;215;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;216;therapist;- a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;217;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;218;therapist; story right?;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;219;client;Yes. Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;220;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;221;client;I'd say so.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;222;therapist;Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;223;client;Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;224;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;225;client;- and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;226;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;227;client;- um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;228;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;229;client;So perhaps you could send me for some different tests.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;230;therapist;Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;231;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;232;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;233;client;Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might-;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;234;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;235;client; might reveal.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;236;therapist;Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;237;client;So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this?;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;238;therapist;Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of-;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;239;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;240;therapist;-your life and causing you a lot-;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;241;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;242;therapist;of disability.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;243;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;244;therapist;I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;245;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;246;therapist;Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy-;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;247;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;248;therapist;- and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;249;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;250;therapist;And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;251;client;Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.;;sustain;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;252;therapist;Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;253;client;No.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;254;therapist;- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;255;client;What-what sort of approach?;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;256;therapist;Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;257;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;258;therapist;And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;259;client;No.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;260;therapist; used to get pleasure out of. is that right?;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;261;client;Well, I just can't do them.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;262;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;263;client;I can't- I can't do them anymore.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;264;therapist;Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling-;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;265;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;266;therapist; unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. and-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;267;client;Oh, I don't know.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;268;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;269;client;I don't know.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;270;therapist;Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up-;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;271;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;272;therapist;- with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally-;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;273;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;274;therapist;- improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking.;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;275;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;276;therapist;And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess.;reflection;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;277;client;Hmm. Yeah.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;278;therapist;What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference?;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;279;client;Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know.;;sustain;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;280;therapist;Right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;281;client;They-they left her and-;;sustain;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;282;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;283;client;- didn't spot it and‚Äî;;sustain;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;284;therapist;Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this-;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;285;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;286;therapist;- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be-;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;287;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;288;therapist;- pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing.;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;289;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;290;therapist;How would that sound?;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;291;client;So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you?;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;292;therapist;I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;293;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;294;therapist;- and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach.;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;295;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;296;therapist;And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara?;therapist_input;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;297;client;Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week.;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;298;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;299;client;And come and see you again-;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;300;therapist;Yes.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;301;client; and talk about it a bit more?;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;302;therapist;Yes. I think so.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;303;client;Okay.;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;304;therapist;I think that would be a good- a good start.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;305;client;All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking.;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;306;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;307;client;I won't bring all the bottles down.;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;308;therapist;Okay. All right.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;309;client;Okay. All right. I'll do that.;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;310;therapist;So, shall I see you again next week?;question;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;311;client;I'll make an appointment for next week. Yes.;;change;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;312;therapist;Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara.;other;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;313;client;Okay. Thank you.;;neutral;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;314;therapist;Bye-bye.;other;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and I ge-I guess she's worried with how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I mean, I-I did agree I would work on the smoking and try to cut back on that. But, as far as the drinking, I-I don't really think I drink that much.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Right, I mean, I don't drink that much and, honestly, it-it's just a good way to relax.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah, exactly. You know, it's kind of like that me time at the end of the day.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Yeah. You know, I have a two-year-old son, and then, I work full-time. And, I also started going back to school. So, you know, just trying to juggle all that stuff. You know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, I just- I wanna relax and enjoy myself.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yeah, and for work, you know, I'm a server. So, I'm on my feet all day, you know, and it's-it's really tiring.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;It's pretty exhausting work.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah, you know, it's hard trying to please customers all day. And then, at the same time, I'm-I'm worrying, am I making enough money to support my son, you know?;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school, but you're also worrying about your finances.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, and then, you know, with going back to school, you know, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything. So, you know, i-it's just a lot right now.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;So, tell me a little bit more about your drinking. Tell me a little bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern.;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Well, that's the thing. I-I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I've-I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day max, you know.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Not much.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, I mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesn't seem like a problem or risky, you know. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. So, i-it just surprises me.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;No. And then, I don't know, I-I'm just getting kind of annoyed, honestly, because, you know, I did agree I would try to work on my smoking, you know. But, with this whole drinking thing, it's like everything that I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. And so, if I give up drinking, like, what am I going to have to enjoy myself, you know.;;sustain;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah, I mean, I guess it has. Probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. I mean, I'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. And, you know, I'm trying to figure out child carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch my son, but, lately, she can't always. And so, I'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able to, you know. So, i-it's just stressful.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more stressed you're feeling, the more you're drinking.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Yeah, I-I guess that's right.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Uh-huh.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;No. I guess, you know, the one- the one thing I can think of is, I mean, there will be evenings when I just kind of want to get my son to bed a little earlier, just so that I can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple drinks. Um, but, I do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know, I'm just wanting to be by myself and relax, you know. So‚Äî;;change;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;And it's perhaps taking you away from things that are more important to you?;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;And it doesn't feel good?;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;No.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;No. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like this. And, so, you know, I-I do feel kind of worried.;;change;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah. I mean, i-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but, you know, I'm trying really hard, you know, to be a good mom. I'm-I'm trying to, you know, go-go back to school. I'm trying to work. So, I don't know how I can do all of that if I don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you know?;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;But on the other hand, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Well, you know, if there was some way that I could relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night, I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind in the same way.;;change;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my son, but she's been kind of backing out lately. And so, I'm worrying, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I going to have to miss class? You know, so, you know, worrying about that really stresses me out, you know.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah. I mean, she watches him so much. I think she's just probably getting stressed out too. And, I feel bad because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but, I need something that I can rely on better.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Anything else?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Well, I mean, most of my problems always go back to money. You know, i-if I had more money, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours, you know? So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to money.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything.;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;therapist;Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other hand, we've talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are.;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;client;Yeah. I mean, I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but, as far as actually doing it, I-I don't know. I mean, I have a lot of problems that I'm trying to work out right now.;;change;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;therapist;So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;client;Childcare, probably.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;therapist;Okay. Yeah. It sounds like from everything you're saying, that keeps coming up as one of the main issues. Um, so there may be some resources I can point you towards, but I'm- guess I'm wondering, have you looked into alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;client;Not really. I mean, I just normally see if my mom can watch my son, so, you know, I haven't really looked around.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;therapist;Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;therapist;Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-;other;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;therapist;-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;client;Yeah, I-I think I would. I mean, it's-it's been nice to just talk about everything that's going on.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;therapist;Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, great. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of things, uh, to pursue.;other;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;therapist;Anything-anything else?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;client;Mm-mm;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;therapist;Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;client;Well, I mean, I could at least try to going back to one drink a night instead of two.;;change;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;therapist;Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;client;Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know how it's going to go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking already, but, I mean, I can try.;;change;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;therapist;Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways.;reflection;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;client;I don't think so.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;therapist;Okay. Well, that sounds good. So, why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of update me on how cutting back on your drinking has gone, and also, what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sound good?;question;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;therapist;Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.;other;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;client;Okay. Thanks.;;neutral;;
40;high;reducing drug use;0;client;Pretty good. It's been three months now.;;neutral;;
40;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;Nice.;other;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Um, and‚Äî;;neutral;;
40;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?;question;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;4;client;Right.;;neutral;;
40;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;6;client;Right. It's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well.;;change;;
40;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;Good.;other;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;8;client;Um, and I met a couple new friends.;;neutral;;
40;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;Nice.;other;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;10;client;So‚Äî;;neutral;;
40;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--;reflection;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;12;client;Right.;;change;;
40;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;And how is that going for you?;question;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;14;client;Right. It's been good. I haven't answered the phone when he's called-;;change;;
40;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;16;client;-and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's been good for me to just reach out and like, meet a couple of new people, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I'm living in.;;change;;
40;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;So it sounds like you've made some good changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends.;reflection;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;18;client;Yeah, the new friends, and I've been using the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a little stressed out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me. I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that time.;;change;;
40;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;So it sounds like--;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;0;therapist;So, thank you for coming in today.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;1;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;2;therapist;How are you feeling today?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;3;client;I feel great actually.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;4;therapist;Yeah? Good.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;6;therapist;Good.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;7;client;I feel good.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;8;therapist;And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;10;therapist;and What are your top five?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;11;client;Yes. It was a good, uh, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;12;therapist;Really?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;13;client;Yeah. And, um‚Äî;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;14;therapist;Do you have any idea why that is?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;15;client;I do have an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it. Uh, I didn't realize how severe it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel like it's never too late to change-;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;16;therapist;True.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;17;client;-and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;21;client;Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;23;client;And I can't be the best- the best me possible.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;24;therapist;For someone else?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;25;client;Yeah.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;26;therapist;For your family?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;27;client;For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;28;therapist;You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;29;client;I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, I was letting what I thought other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;30;therapist;Wow.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;31;client;And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;32;therapist;There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm?;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;33;client;Yes, yes.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;34;therapist;So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;35;client;Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent, and I could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like that, if I want to. Nobody's stopping me from it, only me.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;36;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;37;client;So, that's what I want to do.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;38;client;Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;39;therapist;The very first time that you can remember?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;40;client;I would say so, yeah. I don't know if I've ever said that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles];;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;41;therapist;That's not a selfish thing.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;42;client;No-;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;43;therapist;Right.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;44;client;-it's not, it's really not.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;45;therapist;Cool, that's great.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;46;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;47;therapist;Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;48;client;Well, it makes me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, like I matter. Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the things that kind of happened along the way I really didn't notice, is that, um-- Like, let's say for example I like being a teacher or I like being a teacher or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what people think, I started to lose joy doing things I actually enjoy doing.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;49;therapist;Because you're- felt so obligated.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;50;client;Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My passion is gone completely. I don't know I'm just happy to, I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was like lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;51;therapist;Yeah, is that on your top five also;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;52;client;No, but um, the other ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same reason, like I feel like I need to harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other people.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;53;therapist;You get peace with yourself?;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;54;client;Yes, and then I put family happiness.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;55;therapist;That's very good.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;56;client;Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I am unhappy with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my family.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;57;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;58;client;Uh, yeah, when I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm angry at them, I quarrel them.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;59;therapist;You feel resentful.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;60;client;"I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anybody else,"" I don't care, you do what I do I do what I do life goes on [chuckles].";;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;61;therapist;Right.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;62;client;And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a teacher and I could be a really bad teacher. I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;63;therapist;Right.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;64;client;But I don't feel good about that.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;65;therapist;You don't feel fulfilled.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;66;client;No.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;67;therapist;Like you've done anything helpful.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;68;client;Right, right.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;69;therapist;It's because you showed up and you gave out;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;70;client;It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping. It's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should do but to really give something needy, something substantive, something real.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;71;therapist;Meaningful.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;72;client;Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's small.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;73;therapist;Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;74;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;75;therapist;So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;76;client;Yeah. Yeah.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;77;therapist;That's great and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar?;question;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;78;client;Well, one of the things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been really high up there. And it didn't even make it to my top five. It was in my top 12.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;79;therapist;Uh-uh.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;80;client;But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and I don't give any attention to myself. Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if you can't even hear yourself?;;neutral;;
41;high;unidentifiable;81;therapist;All the chattering.;reflection;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;82;client;Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the quiet. It's literally-- I can just be in silence for even if for a few moments. It's amazing the ideas that come to me so quickly and so easily that would take me hours to figure out if I'm stressing.;;change;;
41;high;unidentifiable;83;therapist;Thank you so much for sharing.;other;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;84;client;Thank you, thank you for listening.;;change;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;0;client;I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.;;neutral;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;1;therapist;Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?;reflection;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;2;client;No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.;;change;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;3;therapist;Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?;reflection;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;4;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;5;therapist;And you're not feeling so good about that?;reflection;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;6;client;No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it anyway.;;change;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;7;therapist;Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?;reflection;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?;reflection;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;No, and specifically my father, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to be gaining my weight back.;;neutral;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;So I‚Äî;;neutral;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;Tell me about that.;question;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;14;client;It's as though by me losing weight, it's like I'm somehow disconnecting from my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit into like this perfect American picture and I just want to be healthy, I just want to have a good body and he doesn't think of it that way.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?;therapist_input;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, well, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;Exactly. So, I just avoid it and put it off.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Um, maybe like a four or five.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three.;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;And before you've been putting it off.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day. And I'm just sick of thinking about it.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me really anxious.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;Right.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a good job.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;client;Um, it made me feel good.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;therapist;So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling.;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;client;Yeah, I did.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;therapist;Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;Mm-hmm;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;You know.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;therapist;So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;client;Right;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself.;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a little bit.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;therapist;Mm-hmm;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?;question;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;Yeah. Mm-hmm.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling anxious and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?;reflection;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;client;Yeah.;;change;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;therapist;Okay. Well, thank you, Tanya.;other;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;

44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Right.;other;;;

44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Uh, I usually go out with my friends. Uh, we'll go to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;and just hang out and things.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. When you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Sometimes, [chuckles] I'm gonna be honest sometimes.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink alcohol?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is When there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Oh, so you're drinking a lot?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;A little, yeah.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Okay. And how much are you drinking on the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Um, I don't, we don't get blackout drunk or anything. It's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;I have gotten blackout drunk before-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Like how many drinks?;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay, so you don't even know.;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;So, I'm not-- Yeah.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay. And how much do they typically drink?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;It has a lot of alcohol in it.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group.;therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;So, is that surprising to you?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;A little bit.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and things like that.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;But we haven't always had it-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?;reflection;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;"Um, I would probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, ""Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today.""";;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;And kind of see how that goes. Because‚Äî;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work.;reflection;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;"-of, ""Oh, they're gonna think I look stupid.""";;sustain;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;117;client;My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;118;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;119;client;those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;120;therapist;It sounds like you might be better off without them though. They‚Äôre-;reflection;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;121;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;122;therapist; maybe not very good friends.;reflection;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;123;client;Probably, might be too judgmental.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;124;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking.;therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;125;client;Okay.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;126;therapist;And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend.;therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;127;client;Okay.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;128;therapist;Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?;therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;129;client;Um, I think-- I think the possibility.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;130;therapist;Okay. So-;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;131;client;I think if you make a good plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;132;therapist;Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;133;client;Yeah. I think I can do that.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;134;therapist;Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;135;client;Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends. My band friends, we‚Äôre focused on band-;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;136;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;137;client;-so I can't really‚Äî;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;138;therapist;Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;139;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;140;therapist;You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;141;client;Not too much, to be honest.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;142;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that tough really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-;therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;143;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;144;therapist;-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;145;client;"Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, ""Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?""";;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;146;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;147;client;Like how should I go about that situation?;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;148;therapist;"Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, ""I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health."" ""I don't want to become an alcoholic."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to get liver disease."", ""I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-";therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;149;client;Mm-hmm.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;150;therapist;"-or getting in fights."" You know, one thing you could bring up is, ""I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know, are at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid, and then people post stuff on Instagram.""";therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;151;client;Mm.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;152;therapist;And you know, that's it for their social life. It's like over.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;153;client;Yeah.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;154;therapist;So‚Äî;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;155;client;And-and you know, like professional life as well.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;156;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;157;client;I don't want that biting me in the butt, [chuckles] in the back.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;158;therapist;Yeah. So I think just tell your friends you know, you realized there's always bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore, so you're just not going to.;therapist_input;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;159;client;Okay.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;160;therapist;And then-;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;161;client;I think I can do that.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;162;therapist;-you can tell them to stop too. You know, then that'd be really good. You'd being a good friend.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;163;client;It'd be easier as-- You know, as a group we-we all work together to become better.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;164;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?;question;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;165;client;No. I think- I think I'm good.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;166;therapist;Okay. So, like I said, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;167;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;168;therapist;And make sure that you actually quit drinking.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;169;client;Okay.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;170;therapist;All right.;other;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;171;client;Sound good.;;change;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;172;therapist;Great.;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;Hi, Mary, how was your day?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;1;client;Fine. Where do you want me to sign?;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;3;client;Not really.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well.;therapist_input;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;5;client;Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;7;client;It's just like the same thing every day like, I don't really know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Yup.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;11;client;I guess so.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.;therapist_input;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;13;client;So you just wanna know my business?;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.;therapist_input;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;19;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;20;therapist;Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;21;client;Yeah. I mean I guess I'll be here if I have to be but I can't make any promises that I won't leave.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;22;therapist;So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;23;client;No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;24;therapist;Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;26;therapist;I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;27;client;It's just like a lot.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;29;client;And you feel like there's all these rules.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;30;therapist;Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.;reflection;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;31;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;32;therapist;Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone.;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;33;client;Right, I think that's the only thing that I wish I had now.;;change;;
45;high;compliance with rules;34;therapist;Your freedom?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;36;therapist;What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;37;client;I guess like your sign your papers.;;change;;
45;high;compliance with rules;38;therapist;Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do.;therapist_input;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;39;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;40;therapist;What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;41;client;Not do this again so that I don't ever have to be here and be stuck in my house and all of these people coming to visit me and know my business.;;change;;
45;high;compliance with rules;42;therapist;So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?;question;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;43;client;Yup.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;44;therapist;That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that.;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;46;therapist;Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;47;client;Not really.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;48;therapist;Okay, well just so you know, again, I do have to come back so I'll see you later today then.;therapist_input;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;49;client;All right.;;neutral;;
45;high;compliance with rules;50;therapist;All right.;other;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;51;client;Bye.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;No.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?;other;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?;therapist_input;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. So, let's take a look. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol use?;therapist_input;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a few beers and when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, and sometimes rum and cokes.;;sustain;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track.;;sustain;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. And how often?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Um, probably about once or twice a month.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Probably since last October.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;What do I like about it?;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. It tastes good.;;sustain;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.;reflection;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I don't like when I get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;No, but that happened to someone I know, though.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles];;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Yeah, but I only missed school once.;;sustain;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?;therapist_input;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol.;therapist_input;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Um, probably a five.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, not drink.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No, not really.;;sustain;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.;therapist_input;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;I could probably do that.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;I don't know.;;neutral;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Do you think you could go two months without drinking?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah, probably.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Anything else to make things easier for you?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?;question;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah. The-- My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me.;;change;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?;reflection;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;0;therapist;All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;1;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;2;therapist;What was different this time and your thoughts about coming?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;3;client;I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;4;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;5;client;I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;6;therapist;Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;8;therapist;"Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together-";therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;9;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;10;therapist;"-and, uh--"" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really.";therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;12;therapist;So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.;reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;14;therapist;Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;15;client;Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;16;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;18;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;20;therapist;"Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?";question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;21;client;Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;22;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;23;client;Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;24;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;25;client;That's why I am still a bit‚Äî;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;26;therapist;Yeah, that's okay.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;27;client;[chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;28;therapist;So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if‚Äî;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;29;client;When I'm feeling uncomfortable?;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;30;therapist;"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful.";therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;31;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;32;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;33;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;34;therapist;Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.;reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;35;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;36;therapist;So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;37;client;[sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;38;therapist;Yeah, okay.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;39;client;Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so-;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;40;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;41;client;-I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;42;therapist;Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah.;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;43;client;About 80. [chuckles];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;44;therapist;About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;45;client;I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;46;therapist;Yeah? But, what would-;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;47;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;48;therapist;-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;49;client;What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;50;therapist;Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;51;client;It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?;;sustain;;
49;high;reducing gambling;52;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;53;client;When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter-;;sustain;;
49;high;reducing gambling;54;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;55;client;-so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles];;sustain;;
49;high;reducing gambling;56;therapist;Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;57;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;58;therapist;Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with‚Äî;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;59;client;Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles];;sustain;;
49;high;reducing gambling;60;therapist;Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-;reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;61;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;62;therapist;-'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;64;therapist;Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;65;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;66;therapist;Yeah? Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;68;therapist;There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;69;client;I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but‚Äî;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;70;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;71;client;Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;72;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;73;client;I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards-;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;74;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;75;client;-so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;76;therapist;Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;77;client;Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;78;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;79;client;I don't know. Kids maybe, but-;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;80;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;81;client;-I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;82;therapist;Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.;reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;83;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;84;therapist;"Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-";reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;85;client;[chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;86;therapist;"-wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls a";reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;87;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;88;therapist;And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;90;therapist;When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;91;client;Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;92;therapist;I don't know.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;93;client;I don't know. It's been fun up to now-;;sustain;;
49;high;reducing gambling;94;therapist;What's your hunch? Yeah.;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;95;client;-but I really do wanna travel, so.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;96;therapist;Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what‚Äî;question;;;

49;high;reducing gambling;98;therapist;Egypt?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;99;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;100;therapist;Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;101;client;Oh, I just think it's just fascinating.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;102;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;103;client;Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and-;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;104;therapist;Oh.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;105;client;-somewhere I've always wanted to go.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;106;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;107;client;It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles].;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;108;therapist;No, that's true.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;110;therapist;But for obvious times.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;111;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;112;therapist;It could be very different.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;113;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;114;therapist;Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;115;client;Oh, since I was young, early teens.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;116;therapist;Oh, yeah?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;117;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;118;therapist;Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;119;client;Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;120;therapist;Yeah. Well, yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;121;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;122;therapist;There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;123;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;124;therapist;Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;125;client;I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;126;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;127;client;Yeah. It will be a big change.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;128;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;129;client;Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;130;therapist;No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;131;client;Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;132;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;133;client;You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;134;therapist;Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment.;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;135;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;136;therapist;We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe-;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;137;client;Mm. [chuckles];;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;138;therapist;-it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah?;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;139;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;140;therapist;Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;141;client;Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;142;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;143;client;Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;144;therapist;Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;145;client;What? Cutting off some of my friendships?;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;146;therapist;Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;147;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;148;therapist;Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;149;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;150;therapist;It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;151;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;152;therapist;Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;153;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;154;therapist;So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits.;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;155;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;156;therapist;Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;157;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;158;therapist;-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;159;client;Mm. Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;160;therapist;Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;161;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;162;therapist;Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;163;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;164;therapist;Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?;question;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;165;client;Find the scissors. [laughs];;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;166;therapist;Yeah, find the scissors.;reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;167;client;Cut out the girls.;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;168;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;169;client;Then, um, I don't know if the debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find-;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;170;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;171;client;-a way to pay them off and-;;change;;
49;high;reducing gambling;172;therapist;Truly.;reflection;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;173;client;-I don't know how I'm gonna do that.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;174;therapist;Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;175;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;176;therapist;Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a great service here, um, and something that you can get to.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;177;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;178;therapist;So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.;therapist_input;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;179;client;Mm-hmm, that will be good.;;neutral;;
49;high;reducing gambling;180;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;181;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;client;So, uh, I guess the issue is that, um, you know, my doctor seems to think that my-my blood pressure's a little high, but I really don't think that there's a problem. And you know, I eat really well. Um. And, you know, she suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me.;;sustain;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;therapist;Okay. Um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a little bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?;reflection;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;client;Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a little jittery and, you know, I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers, but-- And-and working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look so highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. But you know, it-it keeps me awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. And so I really don't see that it's a-it's a real issue.;;sustain;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;client;Um, you know, and-and-- I mean, maybe my blood pressure is a little high, but‚Äî;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;therapist;Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?;reflection;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;therapist;Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss may not want you, you know, checking out-;reflection;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;client;Right.;;neutral;;

50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;client;Gotta stay on, yeah.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;therapist;Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. Does that sound about right?;question;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;client;Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and sometimes, like I said, it does kind of make me a little jittery and, um, I don't know. I-I-I'm not- I'm not as happy and relaxed as I normally am. But you know, I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-and I'm-- I-I feel like I'm much more observant.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;therapist;Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?;question;;;

50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;client;What-What their bodies are like.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;therapist;Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?;therapist_input;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;client;Reducing it, like-- what do you mean?;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;therapist;The number. Just the number.;therapist_input;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;Yeah, yeah but, I mean, how-how much are we talking?;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;I don't-- you tell me. I mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day.;therapist_input;;;

50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;I just really like the flavors.;;sustain;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;So I-I definitely don't want to give that up, but‚Äî;;sustain;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;I gotcha. Okay.;other;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;Uh‚Äî;;neutral;;

50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;And then, of course, you know, working a 12-hour shift, I-I really think that, you know, the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is-is a really good idea too.;;sustain;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;I could probably get up the mid-morning.;;change;;

50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;I think so. So you've identified one of the four that might-- you might be willing to-to try-;reflection;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;for a while to-to let go of. What do you- What do you think of that?;question;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;client;I think that does sound all right.;;change;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;therapist;Good.;other;;;

51;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Tell me what you know about the flu shot?;question;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Uh, well, I know the flu can be pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good health, so I don't really feel like I need it. Uh, it's kind of just more for old people, right?;;sustain;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Mm, um, so you're thinking it's really just for people who are-are vulnerable to illness?;reflection;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?;question;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.;therapist_input;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?;question;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well-;;neutral;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;and my co-worker is pregnant too.;;neutral;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;So-so, yeah, I guess, I should, uh, get it for their sake.;;change;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Okay, so you've got some people in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them.;reflection;;;

53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Laura. So, thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. And then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right.;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Okay. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Um, mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends, things like that.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Uh, yeah, if it's school-related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to the movies or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, I like to read and I like to go outside and, like, take walks and, like, hike and stuff. I'm very outdoorsy, so-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;That's great. What do you think you'll study?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I'm-I'm looking at the journalism, maybe pre-law.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Oh, neat.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;-which is a little different, but-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah, that's great. That's a really good goal.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah. Thanks.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm getting mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good, I'm okay.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I think all my grades are A's and B's, so, yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Um, I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll leave home or something.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Um, well, I'm definitely not a math or science person, so I started off by there that I started looking at careers that maybe I would like. So-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. Great. Sounds like you have, like I said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. Um, you said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Okay. And how often do you think you drink?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?;reflection;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Possibly, yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?;reflection;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah, I guess you can say that.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Um, just two drinks at a party at the most. I don't-- I don't like to drink a lot. I don't-- Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. So, I just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. It's just like to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of- a lot of the time, I don't even drink at all. So-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;But you've been drunk before?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.;reflection;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay. Um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No, I have drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. Uh, how much do your friends drink?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, I mean, I have some friends that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are people that drink a lot more.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Definitely, yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;And do you hang out with them?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Not really closely, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close friends of mine.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Um, yeah. That makes sense.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, yeah, I have. That's, uh, one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;So-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah. Definitely, yeah.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;But you're still drinking.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a party, so-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Um, definitely not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;-make it look like I am, kind of.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;safer.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol, they are the ones you mentioned, like, health-wise and things like that, so, I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Okay.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll just not have a drink.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Um, I really can't control what they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay, and-and what if they won't?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Well, then, I guess, I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Okay.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of people who are gonna keep drinking-;reflection;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Yeah.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;-they're probably not a good influence.;reflection;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;Okay, yeah.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Um, and then, then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder and, you know, if you're needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Okay, yeah, definitely.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Okay, so, um, that's great 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;They would be pretty upset. Yeah. They don't really condone alcohol use.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;So-;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Okay.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here?;therapist_input;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Um, no, no. I think I'm good.;;change;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Okay. Um, any questions or anything-;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Uh, no.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;like that?;question;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;I have no questions.;;neutral;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in.;other;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Okay, thanks.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;0;therapist;Oh, hello Scott.;other;;;
54;high;managing life;1;client;Hi.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;2;therapist;Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.;reflection;;;
54;high;managing life;3;client;I do.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;4;therapist;What's going on with that?;question;;;
54;high;managing life;5;client;Well, I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of years I've just-- I stopped going. I got busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, I feel like I need to get back.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;6;therapist;Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there.;therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;7;client;Okay. Um. All right. Um‚Äî;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;8;therapist;What gym do you belong to?;question;;;
54;high;managing life;9;client;Uh, I belong to the-the Sport Fitness Center.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. And-and how far away is it from your house?;question;;;
54;high;managing life;11;client;Just a couple of miles.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;12;therapist;Just a couple of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too.;therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;13;client;If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;14;therapist;Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk];therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;15;client;[inaudible 00:01:33] training.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;16;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
54;high;managing life;17;client;It-it-it would be important.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;18;therapist;Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?;question;;;
54;high;managing life;19;client;Well, I-I-I-I would feel better. My-- I'd-I'd be able to wear more my clothes. I've been growing around the middle and I'd like to, uh, you know, go back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
54;high;managing life;21;client;I-I'm more comfortable-- I feel better. I think that's the main thing.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;22;therapist;Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but‚Äî;therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- I-I am- I'm not getting any younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18];;change;;
54;high;managing life;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before.;reflection;;;
54;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;26;therapist;Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it.;therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;27;client;I've gotta make time.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;28;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
54;high;managing life;29;client;I've gotta make time.;;change;;
54;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.;therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;31;client;Yeah. Okay.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;32;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
54;high;managing life;33;client;All right.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;34;therapist;So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about.;therapist_input;;;
54;high;managing life;35;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay?;other;;;
54;high;managing life;37;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;38;therapist;All right, so I'll see you next week.;other;;;
54;high;managing life;39;client;Okay. Very good. Thanks.;;neutral;;
54;high;managing life;40;therapist;All right. All right. Bye.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home.;question;;;
56;high;managing life;1;client;Pretty good.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;2;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
56;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;4;therapist;Yeah. What are you really glad about?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;5;client;Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;6;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;8;therapist;I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;9;client;Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;10;therapist;So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down.;question;;;
56;high;managing life;11;client;Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;12;therapist;Mm. So you've been working really hard-;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;14;therapist;-through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;15;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;16;therapist;And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;18;therapist;And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;21;client;So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;22;therapist;Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;23;client;Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;24;therapist;What are you concerned about?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;25;client;That I'll- that I'll fall again.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;27;client;I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;28;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;29;client;No.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;30;therapist;And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall.;question;;;
56;high;managing life;31;client;No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;34;therapist;Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-;question;;;
56;high;managing life;35;client;Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;36;therapist;And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;37;client;Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down-;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;38;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;39;client;Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;40;therapist;Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;41;client;And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;42;therapist;Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;44;therapist;might have probably helped you break your fall this time.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;45;client;Right, right.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;46;therapist;Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;47;client;She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;48;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;50;therapist;"Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.""";reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;51;client;"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""betrayed"". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know.";;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;52;therapist;Right.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;53;client;But, um-;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;54;therapist;So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;55;client;Right.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;56;therapist;and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;57;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;58;therapist;Wh-what do you think about that?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;59;client;Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling-;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;60;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;61;client;-really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;62;therapist;Yeah, right.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;63;client;So, um, 'cause I am alone.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;64;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;65;client;So‚Äî;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;66;therapist;So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and--;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;68;therapist;What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;69;client;Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if-;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;70;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;71;client;if something does happen?;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;72;therapist;Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button.;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;73;client;I think I saw something like that on TV.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;74;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;75;client;Is it- does it really work?;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;76;therapist;It does really work.;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;77;client;'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk];;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;78;therapist;Right. Right.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;79;client;It's crazy, it's crazy.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;80;therapist;No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;81;client;Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared-;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;82;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;83;client;-you know, about that happening and-;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;84;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;85;client;So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes.;;change;;
56;high;managing life;86;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;87;client;Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to?;;change;;
56;high;managing life;88;therapist;We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe.;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;90;therapist;So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider.;question;;;
56;high;managing life;91;client;That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that.;;change;;
56;high;managing life;92;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;93;client;I definitely wanna do that.;;change;;
56;high;managing life;94;therapist;Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;95;client;Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and-;;change;;
56;high;managing life;96;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;97;client;-one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs];;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;98;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;99;client;So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives-;;change;;
56;high;managing life;100;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;101;client;far away.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;102;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;103;client;So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;104;therapist;So you'd like to have a little bit more support-;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;105;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;106;therapist;-and a little bit more connection maybe that-;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;107;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;108;therapist;-that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;110;therapist;Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home-;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;111;client;Right.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;112;therapist;-and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you?;question;;;
56;high;managing life;113;client;Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?;;change;;
56;high;managing life;114;therapist;Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before-;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;115;client;Yes, great place.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;116;therapist;-and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;117;client;Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving?;;change;;
56;high;managing life;118;therapist;Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe.;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;119;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;120;therapist;And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be.;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;121;client;Really?;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;122;therapist;Yes.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;123;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;124;therapist;Can't prevent all of it-;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;125;client;Uh-huh.;;neutral;;
56;high;managing life;126;therapist;but we can make it less likely.;therapist_input;;;
56;high;managing life;127;client;Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak.;;change;;
56;high;managing life;128;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;129;client;Yeah. It's scary.;;sustain;;
56;high;managing life;130;therapist;Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for.;other;;;
56;high;managing life;131;client;Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet.;;change;;
56;high;managing life;132;therapist;Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of-;reflection;;;
56;high;managing life;133;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;

57;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Uh, I talked with my doctor about my medicine. That's his job.;;sustain;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;But well, it's my job too, uh, to-to help you understand how to use your medicine and, uh, give you information about getting the most benefits from it.;other;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Well, to be honest with you, I'm not even certain I'm going to take the medicine. Now, I know I got high cholesterol, I've got to get that down, but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford that. I'm a truck driver and I haul those heavy boxes in on the dollies and I just can't afford that, so you know.;;sustain;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So your-your-your doctor told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you're at risk of stroke or heart attack?;therapist_input;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Yeah, down the line, but-;;sustain;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Okay. Well, the-the side effect is something that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse.;therapist_input;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Well, right now it's the muscle weakness that-that I'm concerned about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present, uh, I've got to do my job.;;sustain;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Well, I-I-I understand that. Um, but like I said, it's very rare. If you feel some muscle weakness, you'll let your doctor know. It's not permanent, okay? Yeah, it won't get to the blood- it won't get to the point where it affects your job‚Äî;therapist_input;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Well, you know- why don't you just give me the medicine, I'll take it home and I'll think about it? But you know, I'm worried about my job.;;sustain;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;You- you really need to take it, and-and like I said, the-the muscle weakness is rare. If you feel muscle weakness, just let your doctor know. He can take you off or switch. It's not permanent.;therapist_input;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Sure. Fine. Just‚Äî;;change;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;It's-it's not permanent.;other;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Whatever.;;neutral;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;Okay? So a stroke or heart attack is much worse, so make sure you go ahead and pick up your medicine as you're on your way out and, uh, one-one every day to get your cholesterol down.;therapist_input;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Okay, sure. Fine.;;change;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Okay.;other;;;

61;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Well, like Dr. Fields told me, it helps with balance, and I'm still having the wobblies. So, I was really hoping that I could get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer. Um, yeah, mostly my balance, mostly my balance.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Uh-huh. So, you're hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?;reflection;;;

61;high;adhering to medical procedure;56;therapist;And so, are you wanting to go back to tai chi?;question;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;57;client;[sighs] Um, yes-yes I-I do because I-- my friend, I think I told you, really, really loves it and I just, I wish I could go back, and yes I do. I'm not making much sense, but I do.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;58;therapist;Uh-huh. I think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;59;client;Oh, I don't really know yet after just one time.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;60;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;61;client;Yeah. It's-it's-- I can't make that-- It wouldn't be fair for me to say it does or doesn't. It didn't that one time, but you know.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;62;therapist;So, you haven't seen the results that you want yet-;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;64;therapist;-but because Dr. Fields has recommended it and your friend has-;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;65;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;66;therapist;-and it sounds like you like the instructor-;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;67;client;Yeah, I do.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;68;therapist;-it sounds like you'd like to try and give it another chance?;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;69;client;Yeah, I would.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;70;therapist;So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?;question;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;71;client;Well, I'd have to make the arrangements again, that was a little complicated, and, um, I'd have to get my head straight about feeling self-conscious, because I-I know that nobody's really looking at me, but I have to convince myself.;;sustain;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;72;therapist;Uh-huh. Yeah.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;73;client;Yeah, and the arrangement, arrangements a little complicated.;;sustain;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;74;therapist;Uh-huh. So, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very confident that you can make the arrangements in order to get to tai chi.;question;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;75;client;That I can make the arrangement?;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;76;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;77;client;Five.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;78;therapist;Five.;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;79;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;80;therapist;Uh-huh, so-;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;81;client;I-I mean, I know I can, but it's really difficult.;;sustain;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;82;therapist;Uh-huh. What is it that makes it a five instead of a one, no confidence?;question;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;83;client;That I'm doing it by myself.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;84;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;85;client;And I would really fe-- If I could have some sup-- Like if somebody could help me do it.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;86;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;87;client;My-my daughter can't visit that often and, um-;;sustain;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;88;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;90;therapist;So, in order for you to feel more confident, you would like some help in making those arrangements?;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;91;client;I would.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;92;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;93;client;I would.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;94;therapist;And is that something that your daughter can do for you?;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;95;client;Well, she's-- she could, but I'd have to wait at least a week.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;96;therapist;Okay. Um, so is that something that you'd like us to help you with?;question;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;97;client;I would.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;98;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;99;client;Yeah, yeah. Is that possible?;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;100;therapist;Sure we can make those arrangements with the rehab center. They have a van-;therapist_input;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;101;client;Uh-huh.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;102;therapist;-and-and they've done this for other patients so we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd like.;therapist_input;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;103;client;That would- that would be good. And then as far as feeling self-confident, I'd have to do that myself.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;104;therapist;Okay. So, are there any other barriers or obstacles in the way to you getting to tai chi?;question;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;105;client;Um, I can't think of any.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;106;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;107;client;That's-that's the main thing-;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;108;therapist;All right.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;109;client;the arrangements.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;110;therapist;Well, it sounds like you can see that you're making some progress in your physical therapy.;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;111;client;Yes.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;112;therapist;And that you're wanting to give tai chi another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you to get there with the van to the rehab center, that you'll give it another chance.;reflection;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;113;client;That's-- Yeah.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;114;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;115;client;That's true.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;116;therapist;Well, um, before you leave today, we'll go ahead and, um, I'll call the rehab center and make those arrangements.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;117;client;You would?;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;118;therapist;Sure. I'm-I'm happy to do that.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;119;client;That would really help.;;change;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;120;therapist;And then when you come back in, I know you've got another follow up appointment with Dr. Fields, I'd like to check back with you then and see how class went the second time.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;121;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;122;therapist;All right.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;123;client;Yeah. Thank you.;;neutral;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;124;therapist;Well, thank you very much for coming in today Mrs. Smith and I look forward to hearing about the progress that you're making.;other;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;125;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;- doing today?;question;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;I'm good, thanks.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Good. Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?;question;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Um, I guess everything's fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I don't know.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;I'm not sure of that.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details.;reflection;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah, I know that she said I have to get so many hours in, but I don't- I don't know. I kind of was half-listening.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?;question;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;I know that I have to get it done by the end of my probation, except I forgot like how many hours or if I'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it for me or I-I told you I'm confused.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Okay, gotcha. So, you know, that it needs to get done-;reflection;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;therapist;Yes.-you know, you have till the end of your probation-;reflection;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;therapist;-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.;reflection;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;client;Exactly, yeah.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;therapist;Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.;other;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;therapist;Is that all right?;other;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;therapist;Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;client;Um, yeah, I just, so I still have to find the community service hours myself?;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;therapist;So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;therapist;So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call.;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;therapist;And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together.;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;client;Okay, so I would do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in like a weekend or how does that work?;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;therapist;Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time.;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;[unintelligible 00:02:20];;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-;reflection;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that so;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;client;I think it's a good idea.;;change;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week.;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;What other questions do you have for me about community service?;other;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done.;;change;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;therapist;Yup, absolutely.;other;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;But you know that if you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for- to be a support for you.;therapist_input;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;All right, thank you.;;neutral;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;You're welcome.;other;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?;therapist_input;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Definitely.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;5;client;I do some meth.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;Snort it, smoke it?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Snort it, always snort it.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;Don't inject it?;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;9;client;Mm-mm.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;Use any other drugs?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;11;client;Just, you know, some alcohol.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;And, uh, um, you do this how often?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Meth?;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Um, two, three times a month.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;17;client;Right.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;Only snort it?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;19;client;Right.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;20;therapist;Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?;therapist_input;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;21;client;Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;23;client;Definitely, yeah.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;25;client;Yeah.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;27;client;No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.;therapist_input;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;29;client;I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.;;sustain;;
63;high;reducing drug use;30;therapist;So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;31;client;Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;32;therapist;Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;33;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;34;therapist;-with zero being not ready at all-;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;35;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;36;therapist;-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;37;client;Uh, three.;;sustain;;
63;high;reducing drug use;38;therapist;Why not a one or a two?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;39;client;I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;40;therapist;Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;41;client;Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;42;therapist;Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;43;client;Yeah.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;44;therapist;Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;45;client;Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;46;therapist;How could you get a different social life?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;47;client;It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it.;;sustain;;
63;high;reducing drug use;48;therapist;Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;49;client;My sister.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;50;therapist;Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;51;client;I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;52;therapist;So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine.;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;53;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;54;therapist;And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support.;reflection;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;55;client;Yes.;;change;;
63;high;reducing drug use;56;therapist;Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you.;therapist_input;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;57;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
63;high;reducing drug use;58;therapist;I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?;question;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;59;client;Yeah, sure.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Well, welcome, Ricky.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Nice to meet you.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Yeah, you too.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;And you found us okay?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Yeah. Yeah. pretty straightforward-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;Yeah;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;9;client;always good.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;Have you been here before?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;11;client;No. No, not at all.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;15;client;"Sure. Um, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, I had sort of like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was sort of like, ""Well, mm."" And I was quite annoyed by that at first, but I-I suppose, you know, I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe.""";;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;Right.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;And that's led you to being here today?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;20;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;21;client;Yeah. I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll‚Äî;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;23;client;Yeah, I guess. I-I suppose I hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- I mean I could, uh, I could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd‚Äî;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;They were concerned for you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;27;client;Yeah. Yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, I suppose.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;You were surprised?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;29;client;"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I don't know. You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""You know, you need to go and get help."" And then-- I don't know. Like you know those characters and, they-they do need help, you know-";;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;30;therapist;Yep.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;31;client;-because they're fucked.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;33;client;"And you kind of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's about am I‚Äî";;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;34;therapist;You're not sure that applies to you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;35;client;Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean? Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was at anywhere near a point that I would need to be sat down and intervened with-;;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;36;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;37;client;if you know What I mean.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;38;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;39;client;I suppose.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;40;therapist;I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;42;therapist;-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;43;client;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they are my friends and-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;45;client;- you know, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know? And they do care, so obviously, there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on the other ha;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;46;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;47;client;-and just check it up, yep.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;48;therapist;Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;49;client;Yeah, pretty right.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;50;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;51;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;52;therapist;Well, let's do some checking out.;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;53;client;Okay, cool.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;54;therapist;So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;55;client;Um, dr-drugs, I guess.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;57;client;Mm, yeah. Sort of kind of do a bit of P now and again-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;58;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;59;client;-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend sometimes.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;60;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;61;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;62;therapist;Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;63;client;Um, a couple of times a week maybe.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;64;therapist;Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;65;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;66;therapist;This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;67;client;Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;68;therapist;Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;69;client;Right. Um, I suppose it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I've-- Like, um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;71;client;And, um, I still live in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. And, um, kind of just when I first got here I was sorta introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;72;therapist;I know Family Bar, yes.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;73;client;"Yeah. It's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then kinda hung out there and just met these people that were sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland bars like that you can just-- Uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose in Palmy you can't as easily. Um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these people that were just really friendly, you know, and-and not judge me into it. I don't know. You know, Palmy often is they're sort of like, ""Oh, you've gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down the Main Street,"" and I just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time. I just want to go out and dance and stuff like that. Um, that was quite cool for me to know that that existed because I hadn't seen that before and-and I suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, you know?";;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;74;client;"It's quite a heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, I guess when I have-have a slight-- I don't know, you just feel really good, I guess. Just feel, like, happy, and excited, and just to be surrounded by people that, you know, really care about you, and love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you didn't-- don't get that as much, it's just really cool, you know, to-to be able to go, ""Okay, on this day I can take this."" And it's just that instant, like, ""I know- I know I'll feel good."" I guess that's part of it.";;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;75;therapist;So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;76;client;Yeah, in-in a way. Although I wouldn't have been conscious of that really. I just sort of discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland looking for that kinda-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;77;therapist;Right.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;78;client;-lift to get away from, um, you know parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, that Palmy sort of lifestyle. But then yeah, I discovered this other thing, um‚Äî;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;79;therapist;Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;80;client;No.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;81;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;82;client;No. I didn't really know. I guess you see sort of things like that in-in movies from America you know, but you don't really-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;83;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;84;client;- think that it would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;85;therapist;Palmerston. Mm-hmm.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;86;client;Um, I don't mean to be mean about Palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, I guess, kinda- this done-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;87;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;88;client;to that sort of thing.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;89;therapist;It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;90;client;Yes-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;91;therapist;And-and you came-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;92;client;-plus-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;93;therapist;here to Auckland.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;94;client;Yeah, yeah. I definitely wanted to get away from something. I didn't know what too, but then I arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was obviously, fate or whatever was pulling me to this thing-;;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;95;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;96;client;-'cause-'cause like I found something in myself or something that was missing.;;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;97;therapist;And how does that feel for you now?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;98;client;"Um, now, I guess, now, I'm just a little used to it. [clears throat] When I first got here, I was like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" This is hard, I guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like I've gotten used to it.";;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;99;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;100;client;"I mean, I guess, I'm, let's say I take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, it's just a sort of what I do really. Yeah, so, I guess that the drugs are linked to that, I suppose. It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really think-- I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kinda, ""Okay, I'm gonna go hang with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, that Saturday, Friday night thing. And then it just happens really as part of that.";;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;101;therapist;So coming out, feeling-- being gay-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;102;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;103;therapist;-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;104;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;105;therapist;for you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;106;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;107;therapist;And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;108;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;109;therapist;And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;110;client;Well, I guess, now, that I think about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice that.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;111;therapist;So‚Äî;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;112;client;I mean like I always-- Well, it's, you know it's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends but, I guess, sometimes in the weekdays. You know, I'll-I'll pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or something if I just kinda feel like doing something then I might do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself I might have a smoke by myself or something like that. And I guess that isn't entirely linked to that scene, I suppose.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;113;therapist;It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;114;client;Mm. Maybe. I suppose I hadn't really thought about it-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;115;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;116;client;until recently.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;117;therapist;So something's changed recently?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;118;client;Yeah. I suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt. And it's-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;119;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;120;client;-maybe noticing some things that I hadn't noticed but‚Äî;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;121;therapist;Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;122;client;Oh, I mean, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;123;therapist;That surprised you?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;124;client;"Mm. S-surprised me to-to think about, you know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but then if someone asked you, you know, how often or-- and then you kind of have to quantify it, I suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if I- if I imagine myself sort of saying, ""I do this, you know, a few times a week."" It-it-";;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;125;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;126;client;-sounds shocking. But to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, you know, that's kind of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I, [clears throat] that's why I kind of got a bit miffed at my friends a little bit, or I dunno, a bit defensive there.;;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;127;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;128;client;felt a bit weird.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;129;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;130;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;131;therapist;So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet‚Äî;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;132;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;133;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;134;client;Definitely.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;135;therapist;So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;136;client;Yep. Um. Uh, I suppose money is quite a big thing. Like, I used to have a lot more money sorta last year. I had a, quite a good job, like a, quite a regular acting job.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;137;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;138;client;Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that money a little bit. Um, so now I don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm working in a cafe like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. So now it's kinda like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a bit of help with the rent sometimes.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;139;therapist;Quite a lot's changed over the last year from‚Äî;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;140;client;Yeah. Yeah. A little bit.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;141;therapist;It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;142;client;No. But you know, that's the life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;143;therapist;Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;144;client;No.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;145;therapist;-and it's-it's hard-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;146;client;It's not.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;147;therapist;-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;148;client;Hmm. Could have been a couple of auditions that I didn't do so well and as I could have 'cause of that.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;149;therapist;The drug may have had an effect on that?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;150;client;"Uh, maybe. Maybe it's just my general sort of state. Um,I dunno, sometimes I suppose just kind of weighs on my mind a little bit like, ""What am I doing or why am I spending my money on this?"" I mean, when it's happening, it's like, this is amazing.";;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;151;therapist;Hmm. Hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;152;client;You know am I-- You go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, I could just as well have saved that money and actually gone to interesting places I suppose. But I don't know. I wonder if it- if-if it's having an effect. I-I don't know. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the face, I dunno. [crosstalk] Dunno if I look tired or-or run down or-;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;153;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;154;client;-or if I actually am tired or run down, I suppose. Again, this is things that I haven't really thought about-;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;155;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;156;client;-but now I'm starting to think about.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;157;therapist;Right. And they got questions too-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;158;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;159;therapist;-to ask are they‚Äî;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;160;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;161;therapist;You're beginning to-to think about those things and-and-and what effect they may have on you.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;162;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;163;therapist;And the choices that you might have about it.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;164;client;Yeah. Hmm.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;165;therapist;What else? Are the-the-the-the problem of around the use of money, you know, the choices that you make around money, and the meth use has taken up quite a lot of the money-;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;166;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;167;therapist;-over the last year and maybe also the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as well as you might.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;168;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;169;therapist;And maybe the effects um, also on-on your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effect of meth use on physical appearance.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;170;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;171;therapist;Um, what-- are there any other problems? Any other things that-that are a bit of a downside to this?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;172;client;"Uh, I guess it's obviously having some sort of effect on my friends and my flatmates, 'cause, you know, they set me down and said, ""Look you gotta-";;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;173;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;174;client;"-look into this or else we can't hang out anymore.""";;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;175;therapist;And that's a problem?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;176;client;That would be a problem, yeah.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;177;therapist;Why?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;178;client;If they didn't wanna hang out, well, then what have I got, I suppose?;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;179;therapist;They're important.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;180;client;"Yeah. Yeah, and I mean part of it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot of those friends that set me down are obviously the ones that are not part of that scene. I mean there were a couple there that-that are, but mostly they were the ones that sort of have always sorta been a bit judgy. You know, like when I first started all this stuff, you know. And clearly, there wasn't a problem like-- 'cause I used to be that guy as well you know, like, ""No never do that 'cause it's bad,"" and then you try it the first time and you go, ""Actually, it's not that bad."" It's not the end of the world if you're sensible with it, then it's not gonna be, you know.";;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;181;client;You have to take a stupid amount to do any kind of like, or, you know, to die or to end up in a hospital.;;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;182;therapist;YHmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;183;client;"So it's provided you don't-- you're not stupid with it. Then it's just a bit of fun but you can't really explain that to people who are-- have their walls up. So it's hard not to sit in this room full of people kind of going, ""Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they're bad."" It's like, ""Well actually, you don't know what you're talking about.""";;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;184;therapist;Hmm. But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some friends that you've got who do use who are still concerned about you. Did I get that right from what you said earlier that-that those who are concerned about you and were part of this intervention some of them use.;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;185;client;Yep. Yeah, a couple.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;186;therapist;And you-- So they have their concerns and-and you are beginning to-to ask questions of this use as well and-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;187;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;188;therapist;-it's just that that we're gonna try and drill down a little more into just to pick up for you what-what you think might be going on and what you think might be some of the options for you.;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;189;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;190;therapist;And we're g- we're gonna leave labels all that kind of stuff aside 'cause, you know, I'm picking up from you that that's not what that's about.;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;191;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;192;therapist;I'm happy with that. What do you think will happen, what might happen if you can turn your-your uses- you're on now? What-what concerns do you have about not making any kind of change?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;193;client;Um, well I suppose the acting thing is a really big concern.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;194;therapist;Alright.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;195;client;'Cause I want that to be my job, you know. I'm fucking sick of cafes.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;196;therapist;This is gonna be your career. This is the career-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;197;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;198;therapist;you want to make.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;199;client;I'd like it to be, yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;200;therapist;Mm-hmm. It's harder when you're trying to create your career, get that going. You gotta- you gotta be at your- at your top, top pitch.;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;201;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;202;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;203;client;Yeah, 'cause I mean it's all you know, it's partly lacking and partly being at the right place at the right time. And if you're at the right place and at the right time and it is not on your game then there could have been a‚Äî;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;204;therapist;Yeah, and-and maybe the meth use is-is compromising that.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;205;client;Yeah, it could be.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;206;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;207;client;Yeah, and then I suppose also like money is linked into that as well, you know, I've-- I'm not doing as many courses and stuff as I used to be doing, 'cause it's, you know, don't have the money.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;208;therapist;Alright, so it's back to the money thing again which is-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;209;client;Well, yeah, I mean, obviously I don't wanna keep pissing my flatmates off.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;210;therapist;Yeah. yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;211;client;You know, and it's not- it's not cool to not pay the rent, obviously. It's not something I'm happy with.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;212;therapist;That creates problems?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;213;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;214;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;215;client;Yeah, and I don't wanna be that person.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;216;therapist;Let's just come back to another thing, uh, that we were talking about a little bit earlier, and it's around your meth use as well and-and-and with your gay friends, with gay lifestyle. And-and that sounds like you're saying that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with friends that the meth use is always there?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;217;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;218;therapist;The-the availability of it is there.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;219;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;220;therapist;And everyone, most people are using.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;221;client;Yeah. Not-not necessarily P or whatever but yeah most people are doing something. Yeah. I suppose yeah it's kind of part of that scene that there's not a huge like, you know, you go to normal bars and most people are just drunk and wasted and like spewing everywhere and stuff and whereas that's a different scene. Like, people drink but they don't drink to that excess but they take other things and have a good time. And, yeah.;;sustain;;
64;high;reducing drug use;222;therapist;And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;223;client;Yeah. I mean there are people that do that. I suppose it-it would be hard. I-I haven't really thought about it, I suppose. That's all it is, all I've known that scene to be, you know, 'cause I'm quite new to it, you know-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;224;therapist;Right.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;225;client;so from the beginning it was always there.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;226;therapist;So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;227;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;228;therapist;or particularly on-on meth use?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;229;client;Oh yeah, well, they must be. I can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the ma-majority or at least p-- the majority of people that I know, yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;230;therapist;So that might be something that we can look at but later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still party and party medley, but when meth is not a- is not a dominant-;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;231;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;232;therapist;-factor in that partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, uh, gay groups that support people who-who are not wanting to be-- they have a lifestyle that is heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at some other ideas if ;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;233;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;234;therapist;-to consider, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about huge major changes, it's about how can I improve the situation.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;235;client;Yep. Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;236;therapist;It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;237;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;238;therapist;So that I can pursue that plan.;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;239;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;240;therapist;What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;241;client;Well, [coughs] I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I do it and then I found myself talking about the kind of the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Wednesday by yourself like it doesn't sound that good.;;change;;
64;high;reducing drug use;242;therapist;So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it?;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;243;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;244;therapist;As to what-;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;245;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;246;therapist;-what would work for you-;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;247;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;248;therapist;as an alternative.;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;249;client;Yeah. Yeah, but I think you're right about, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek slump, you know. So far away till people will be in their place where they can-;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;250;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;251;client;hang out and have a good time.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;252;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. And there are things that have gotta work for you, so that-;reflection;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;253;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;254;therapist;-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are.;question;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;255;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;256;therapist;Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;257;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;258;therapist;And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-;therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;259;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
64;high;reducing drug use;260;therapist;"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.""";therapist_input;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;261;client;Yeah. Yep.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;0;client;Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;1;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;2;client;Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;3;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;4;client;if you quit smoking.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;5;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;6;client;Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.;;sustain;;
65;high;smoking cessation;7;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;8;client;That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.;;sustain;;
65;high;smoking cessation;9;therapist;Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.;reflection;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;10;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;11;therapist;It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.;reflection;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;12;client;Right.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;13;therapist;Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.;reflection;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;14;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;15;therapist;I'm wondering what else might be on that list.;question;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;16;client;Um, withdrawal.;;sustain;;
65;high;smoking cessation;17;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;18;client;They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.;;sustain;;
65;high;smoking cessation;19;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;20;client;And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;21;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-;reflection;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;22;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;23;therapist;-the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?;question;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;24;client;Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-;;sustain;;
65;high;smoking cessation;25;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;26;client;not- going through life without smoking.;;sustain;;
65;high;smoking cessation;27;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;28;client;I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-;;change;;
65;high;smoking cessation;29;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;30;client;-at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-;;change;;
65;high;smoking cessation;31;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;32;client;-that made me rethink-;;neutral;;
65;high;smoking cessation;33;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;34;client;everything.;;neutral;;
66;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hi, Mr. Stowe.;other;;;
66;high;diabetes management;1;client;Hey.;;neutral;;
66;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;How are you doing today? I'm Bruce Berger.;question;;;
66;high;diabetes management;3;client;Pleasure to meet you.;;neutral;;
66;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;5;client;Yeah. I'm supposed to learn how to manage it. I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty bad 'cause, uh, she said my blood sugar was sky high, and then she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen. That just sounds so disastrous and, uh, and then she told me I gotta do all this stuff. And man, I'm just sort of disappointed right now.;;sustain;;
66;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;So you just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.;reflection;;;
66;high;diabetes management;7;client;She mentioned my legs having troubles and-;;neutral;;
66;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.;reflection;;;
66;high;diabetes management;9;client;Well, that's, yeah. It's not just being scared, you know. I don't want that to happen to me, but then when I, when-when she reels off all these things I gotta do and I'm sort of going oh, oh, you know, I'm not certain I can even get it done. So it's sort of sitting-- well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my God, this is- this is what's gonna happen to me.;;sustain;;
66;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;So it sounds like-;other;;;
66;high;diabetes management;11;client;And it is discouraging, just like discouraging.;;sustain;;
66;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.;reflection;;;
66;high;diabetes management;13;client;Yeah. It looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. I mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse.;;sustain;;
66;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;Okay. And I-- And what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. I, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-to get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;15;therapist;And I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. You know, for example, there- there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. And honestly, if I was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. How-how does that sound so far?;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;16;client;Well, I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar is really high. and-;;change;;
66;high;diabetes management;17;therapist;So that's easy to do.;reflection;;;
66;high;diabetes management;18;client;Yeah, I'm pretty- I'm pretty good at taking drugs.;;change;;
66;high;diabetes management;19;therapist;Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;20;client;Yeah. I think I could probably do that.;;change;;
66;high;diabetes management;21;therapist;Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;22;client;Well, she also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. And that just seemed like a lot of mumbo jambo to me.;;sustain;;
66;high;diabetes management;23;therapist;Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;24;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral;;
66;high;diabetes management;25;therapist;So it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine, when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact on your blood sugar 'cause getting your blood sugar down is going to keep you from having all of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?;therapist_input;;;
66;high;diabetes management;26;client;Well, I like it that I, you know, that-that we can do it at a step at a time. I mean, that's-- that relieves some pressure.;;change;;
66;high;diabetes management;27;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
66;high;diabetes management;28;client;And being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than-- I-I wasn't certain I could just, wham, put this huge program in[chuckles] into effect. Uh, but doing a step at a time and I, you know, that-- getting on the medicine, I don't think that's any big problem. That I can do I am pretty sure.;;change;;
66;high;diabetes management;29;therapist;It sounds like you're very committed to that.;reflection;;;
66;high;diabetes management;30;client;Yeah. I think I could do that. Uh, as long as there's no big-time side effects, but, uh-;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Something like that.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. How often?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Um, a few times a month.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;9;client;I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;How do you think it affects you?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Well, I don't want to get in trouble like at school.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;How could you get in trouble at school?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Right.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;23;client;well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;What would be the benefits of that?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, I play better when I'm not high.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;29;client;For about a month.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Um, seven.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Uh, I don't know.;;neutral;;
67;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Hmm, I like to play video games.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Anything else?;question;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;41;client;I can play basketball with my friend Sarah.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.;reflection;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;43;client;Yeah.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out.;therapist_input;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;change;;
67;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always good to see you.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Hi. Thank you.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.;therapist_input;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Does that sound okay?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Sure. Um, as you know, I'm Andrea, I, uh, I'm a junior I'm in the marching band. I play the tenor sax.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Oh, neat.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah, I'm also in the-- I'm a bit of a band geek. [laughter] I play, you know, in the wind ensemble and the jazz band, things like that.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Wow. You really are involved in music.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, [crosstalk].;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;When did you start?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Oh, I started playing about 10 years ago, actually.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Wow.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, I started on the violin first, and then I went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Very cool. I've always wanted to be good at music. [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Just kind of everyday sort of stuff?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah [laughs].;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. Tell me a little bit about your family.;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Uh, well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old- years older than me. My parents, and I have a dog [laughs].;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Cute. What kind of dog?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;He's a Golden Retriever.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Oh, nice. Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;My big boy.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;[laughs] Very fun. All right. And how are things going in school for you?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;They're pretty good. Grades have been pretty all right. Still like 3.7 ish.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay, great, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Uh, I'd like to, you know, I'd like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a nice Ivy League school.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Oh, all right.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;But I mean, that might not happen. And then I'd like to go on and become a doctor. Study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay, you have some pretty big dreams.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;That's great. That's really exciting to think about that-;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cult;therapist_input;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?;therapist_input;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, I think a sense of community and belonging.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;I think those two and, um, respect.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Respect, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them. Um, you know how I said I was in the marching band?;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;I really, you know, I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward- together towards that one goal.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;And then in terms of respect, I-I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. Like, I-I really do think respect is important, to respect myself and respect those around me, so.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;I place great importance in that.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yes, purpose.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Definitely, that's right.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Um, sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some good board games and hang out.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Yeah, sometimes.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Uh, well it's mostly just for, for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;I'd say, um, on a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about like two weekends out of the month. Two or three.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie it's not yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Definitely.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;So it's nice to have like that kind of breather-;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;-versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun.;;sustain;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-;;sustain;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;-and not really thinking about stresses or things like that, but it can be--When it's too much drinking, it can be- can be obviously bad.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid. [laughs] Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We-we usually try to be as safe about it;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;-as possible. So we'll like sleep over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be really stupid.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;Yeah;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Sometimes. Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;Can you tell me a little bit about that?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Well, I, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that, that I don't- that's not fun.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;It's not.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;And how often do you think that happens?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;For me, that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;-and that didn't end well.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;But after that, I haven't- but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck de;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;Yeah. People can get a little like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private-;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;117;client;and that kind of stuff.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;118;therapist;So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;119;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;120;therapist;Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;121;client;I just- I've, you know, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;122;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;123;client;So, I, you know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's house or sort of my parents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;124;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;125;client;And so be where I have fun.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;126;therapist;Okay. Yeah, it sounds kinda similar to your, um, your value of respect to yourself.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;127;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;128;therapist;On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;129;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;130;therapist;If there's too much, then it sort of‚Äî;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;131;client;Then it kind of defeats the purpose? [laughs];;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;132;therapist;Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;133;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;134;therapist;Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;135;client;In terms of what? In terms of respect?;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;136;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;137;client;I think, well in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things- I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;138;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;139;client;And then-- But in terms of at- how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything.;;sustain;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;140;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;141;client;And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not gonna go somewhere with a person I met-;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;142;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;143;client;-into I don't know where to, I don't know what, and-;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;144;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;145;client;things like that.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;146;therapist;Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;147;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;148;therapist;of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;149;therapist;Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;150;client;"I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, ""All right, this is my one drink"" and I'm good in that way. I still have something in my cup so people aren't gonna be like, ""Oh, here. Have some more."" I'd be like, ""No, I'm good. I have mine,"" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little.";;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;151;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;152;client;"For the most part, it works pretty well because, like I said, people, you know, people come asking me, trying to pressure me, I'll be like, ""No, I'm good. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later."" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."" And that's when I start, you know, falling into-";;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;153;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;154;client;way too much.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;155;therapist;So, uh, uh, a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would like-;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;156;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;157;therapist;-would like to make some adjustments-;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;158;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;159;therapist;-to-to make it a little smoother. Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;160;client;Um, I'd like to make sure that I'd, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body, I'd like to, you know, try to drink less.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;161;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;162;client;Like I-I-- You know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body, you know.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;163;therapist;Right.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;164;client;Like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;165;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;166;client;And, um, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a- as a community.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;167;therapist;Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;168;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;169;therapist;-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;170;client;I'd say about like-like a six or a seven.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;171;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;172;client;I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If I don't, I don't.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;173;therapist;Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;174;client;Um, because I still think it's-it's important.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;175;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;176;client;I still, you know. Like I said, I don't want to hurt my body. Especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your-your social and your school work and things like. I know that once I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. Like I know that's not- that's not feasible. It's not a good idea.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;177;therapist;Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;178;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;179;therapist;Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;180;client;I think I-;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;181;therapist;on that same scale from one to ten?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;182;client;I think if I made the decision that I was going to, for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know it'd be going through.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;183;therapist;Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;184;client;It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;185;therapist;Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;186;client;Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I'm not going to drink today. And then even if my friends do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;187;therapist;So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;188;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;189;therapist;-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;190;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;191;therapist;Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;192;client;I think so. I think it's-it's very feasible. I think it's possible.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;193;therapist;Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?;therapist_input;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;194;client;I think so. I think that's good.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;195;therapist;Does that sound like something you'd like to do?;question;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;196;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;197;therapist;Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;198;therapist;And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;199;therapist;Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.;reflection;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;200;client;Yeah, I'd like to.;;change;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;201;therapist;All right. Great. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.;other;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;202;client;Perfect. Nice.;;neutral;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;203;therapist;Great.;other;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?;question;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram.;;neutral;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.;therapist_input;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?;;neutral;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.;therapist_input;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay, thanks for that. I have an appointment to run to.;;neutral;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;All right, thanks. Call me anytime.;other;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?;question;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.;;neutral;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?;question;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Um, nothing specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication.;;neutral;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.;therapist_input;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay. Uh, what about side effects?;;neutral;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?;therapist_input;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?;;neutral;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?;question;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Oh, sure.;;neutral;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Fantastic. Thank you.;other;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;-so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;-to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;Yeah, it'd be good.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;I guess it doesn't.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;Yeah. It kinda messes things up.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;Yeah. It makes it harder.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;And harder to‚Äî;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Okay, so you know some people?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;getting a qualification?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;[sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Yes, pretty much.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but‚Äî;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;50;therapist;Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;51;client;Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;52;therapist;Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;53;client;Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;54;therapist;Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech‚Äî;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;55;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;56;therapist;and picked up some forms?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;57;client;Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;58;therapist;Wow.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;60;therapist;That's fantastic, Billy.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;61;client;Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;62;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;63;client;-I got some forms and-;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;64;therapist;Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;65;client;I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;66;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;67;client;-well, the forms, it's too confusing.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;68;therapist;Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;69;client;Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;70;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;71;client;-so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;72;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;73;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;74;therapist;Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;75;client;Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;76;therapist;Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;77;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;78;therapist;Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;79;client;I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;80;therapist;Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;81;client;I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;82;therapist;You don't like writing?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;83;client;No.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;84;therapist;Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;85;client;No, I'm just real messy, so people can't read it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;86;therapist;People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;87;client;[chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;88;therapist;Oh, you must be a doctor.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;89;client;Yeah, I am. [chuckles];;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;90;therapist;Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;91;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;92;therapist;Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;93;client;Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;94;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;95;client;But, we don't have a computer.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;96;therapist;Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;97;client;Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;98;therapist;Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;99;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;100;therapist;-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;101;client;Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just-;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;102;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;103;client;-I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;104;therapist;Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;105;client;No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;106;therapist;Well, have you got the forms with you?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;107;client;No.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;108;therapist;Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;110;therapist;-and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;111;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;112;therapist;-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;113;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;114;therapist;Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;115;client;I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;116;therapist;She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed.;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;117;client;Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in.;;sustain;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;118;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;119;client;At night.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;120;therapist;So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;121;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;122;therapist;-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;123;client;Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good.;;sustain;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;124;therapist;Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;125;client;Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;126;therapist;Mm. Okay.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;127;client;It's a waste of time.;;sustain;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;128;therapist;All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that.;therapist_input;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;129;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;130;therapist;So, what's really getting in the way?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;131;client;For what?;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;132;therapist;Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;133;client;Of what? Well, I don't get it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;134;therapist;Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;135;client;Yeah. I can't.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;136;therapist;-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;137;client;Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;138;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;139;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;140;therapist;Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;141;client;Like--;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;142;therapist;[chuckles];other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;143;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;144;therapist;Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;145;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;146;therapist;So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;147;client;No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;148;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;149;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;150;therapist;So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?;question;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;151;client;I don't know. Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;152;therapist;So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;153;client;It'd make everything easier.;;change;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;154;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;155;client;Like-- I don't really like reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff like that-;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;156;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;157;client;-yeah, that have filling out forms.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;158;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;159;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;160;therapist;And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;161;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;162;therapist;-your course that, you know, to-- the hands-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's the more reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;163;client;Yeah, I didn't think about that.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;164;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;165;client;Yeah, that'd suck if you had to read, like, a big manual or something. Hmm.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;166;therapist;Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before that.;reflection;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;167;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;168;therapist;Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step.;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. And as-as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what I hear, where you were there and, you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as, you know, I'm, um, I'm an honor student. I-I usually I'm studying over the weekend and my parents don't let me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage, to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I- when I got there, like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle-;;neutral;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;-or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be- I wouldn't be ostracized.;;sustain;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;I understand.;;neutral;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;-and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Okay. Um, I know that it's bad for me. It's-it's bad for my body. It's bad for-for-for-for being on the team, for being an athlete. It hinders my performance. Just, I don't know. I-I feel that my-my friends pressure me. I don't know. I feel I should like go with different friend groups. Maybe. I don't know.;;change;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I don't know, like being in a sports team, y-you feel very, you have to like be unified with the group.;;neutral;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Yeah, but you're one of the leaders.;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. So it's like‚Äî;;sustain;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then.;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being, having a stick up my butt, you know.;;sustain;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?;question;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;I mean, it's just one-- I'm just one person against the voice of the mob.;;sustain;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it, you know-;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I understand.;;neutral;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;-I'm not saying I know what it's like. I-I get that you want to have fun in your teenage years. I get that. But, you know, you are a star player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this.;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Well, I'll dedicate the time, not to party and night. Well, not-not-not party, but, you know, get involved with alcohol to that extent. And like, have it publicized on the internet.;;change;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;What do you mean?;question;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet. Like I w- I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time to put on the internet so others can see, even though.;;change;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;All right. Yeah. I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. Okay?;therapist_input;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Right. I'll stop.;;change;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;All right. You promise?;other;;;

72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Shake.;;change;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;All right. I'll see you later.;other;;;

72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;All right.;other;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;0;client;He, um, introduced me to it too, so I've tried it.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;So with his encouragement, you-you tried some drugs.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Oxy.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;You tried oxy? Okay.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;4;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;Okay. And he encouraged you to do that.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;6;client;Well, yeah he said it was a pain- a pain medicine.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you've been having.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;8;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;10;client;And it has, but I don't do it as often, it's just sometimes.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;Okay. So you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and you found that it helped you in certain ways. What are some of the things that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;12;client;Dealing with my grandma's loss.;;sustain;;
73;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;Okay, so that's helped you.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;14;client;Yeah. I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,-;;sustain;;
73;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;Mm-hmm. So it help‚Äî;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;16;client;-I don't wanna have to rely on having to take that.;;change;;
73;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;Okay. So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you've found at least for the moment very helpful?;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;18;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, and‚Äî;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;20;client;Right.;;change;;
73;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;Yeah, okay. Um, and-and so that's a lot going on right now for you? Yeah.;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;22;client;Yeah, it is.;;neutral;;
73;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?;reflection;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;24;client;Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.;;sustain;;
73;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel good.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;0;client;Hi.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;2;client;Good, I'm doing really good.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;Yes, um, so you did do your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about that you discovered?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Yeah, I really like doing this, and, um, I-I rated health as my first-;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;Oh, so it's your first?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;6;client;-uh, value. Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health. Um, and I'm working on, um, a certification to become a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] there's ;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;8;client;Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer worker? You're doing something that you're actually living to do.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;10;client;Yeah, I like being active. You know, if I could, um, be more adept to tennis, and I would love to do something like that coaching people how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but‚Äî;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;Now, have you done this sheet more than once?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;12;client;Yes, I have.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;And then, has health always been number one for you?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;14;client;It's been in the top. It's been up there, yeah. I don't remember if it's always been number one. It's probably definitely been in the top three. Uh, yeah, because I've had problems, um, with inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;Inner harmony is number two?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;16;client;Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had something to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something or something in there.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;18;client;And, um, I put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;20;client;Yeah. Um, since I've been practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been, um, coming to terms with more, that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I'm more at peace with myself, and in-in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating.;;change;;
76;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;22;client;Um, I really feel like-- yeah, I feel like really good about myself.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;23;therapist;So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from?;question;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;24;client;"Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like, um, I don't have to please other people either. It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, ""Well, that's the way a good person should be.They should always put other people first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't so important right now."" I think that is okay to do once in a while. As long as you know- you know that you're not really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you realize, ""Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction.""";;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;25;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;26;client;"Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""I'm obligated to this person.""";;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;27;therapist;Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. Um, it was- it was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when-;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;28;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;29;therapist;-the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self worth, and you know, self-- and-and dealing with-;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;30;client;Self love.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;31;therapist;self love.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;32;client;Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;33;therapist;Yeah that's not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. It's true.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;34;client;Yes. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts myself out. Like I have my brother, his-his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and, uh, I slept on-on the air mattress and, uh, me with my mother and my dad and my sis-- my-- his daughter in the other spare room that I have.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;35;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;36;client;And I do that, but I think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a guest. I could sleep in my bed all the other days. [unintelligible 00:05:54];;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;37;client;So, you know, even if it's a little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen is a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. You know, I'll live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's, um-- it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other things weren't here.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;38;client;But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just also being around people that live in the community that are from other cultures. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. And just also being open to, uh, differences. And then like today, Election Day realizing that something might happen, uh, in the Congress or the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and-and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing I still have to have that inner peace within myself.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;39;therapist;And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;40;client;Right. Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;41;therapist;So, live, um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;42;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;43;therapist;And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;44;client;Yes. And school learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in the summertime really, uh, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction-;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;45;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;46;client;-enjoyment. I think it's intertwined in a lot of things. It's fun to learn about pe-- other people, other cultures. it's fun to have the inner harmony. I think that- I think that was an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pl;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;47;therapist;So pleasure being your number five.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;48;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;49;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;50;client;And when I think of the flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there's gonna be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, um, too that I accept that and that's part of joy.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;51;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;52;client;True joy comes from knowing it's not always gonna be happy. I'm gonna- I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;53;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;54;client;I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;55;therapist;So you've taken that into account that-;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;56;client;Absolutely.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;57;therapist;things may happen in life.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;58;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;59;therapist;It sounds as though your list is like definitely a story. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Uh‚Äî;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;60;client;Inner harmony.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;61;therapist;Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other people or to serve-service.;reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;62;client;Right.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;63;therapist;Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other people. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learning different, you know, cultures and having that broad range of-of just opening your eyes and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I do see the whole world and I know that within myself that I'm able to, you know, accept that I will have things coming out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, uh, it's like, okay, things might happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21];reflection;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;64;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;65;therapist;Well, it was nice talking to you.;other;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;66;client;Yeah, it was nice being here and having you listen to me. Encouraging me was okay.;;neutral;;
76;high;unidentifiable;67;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?;question;;;
78;high;asthma management;1;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;2;therapist;Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;4;therapist;-for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?;question;;;
78;high;asthma management;5;client;It's been- it's been really difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;6;therapist;Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening.;reflection;;;
78;high;asthma management;7;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;8;therapist;Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;9;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;10;therapist;Are you having some difficulties with that?;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;11;client;Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in it and that-that I don't want her taking steroids. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-;;sustain;;
78;high;asthma management;12;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;13;client;I just want to let you know that right off.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;14;therapist;Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.;reflection;;;
78;high;asthma management;15;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;16;therapist;Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?;question;;;
78;high;asthma management;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;18;therapist;Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;19;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;20;therapist;Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;21;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;22;therapist;If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;23;client;Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;25;client;Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;26;therapist;"Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""";therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;28;therapist;You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;29;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;30;therapist;Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?;question;;;
78;high;asthma management;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;32;therapist;Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;33;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;34;therapist;And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;36;therapist;The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;37;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;38;therapist;Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;39;client;Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;40;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;41;client;She's that sensitive. If I realized that‚Äî;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;42;therapist;It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;43;client;Right. Um, so would it help, um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect.;;sustain;;
78;high;asthma management;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;45;client;I mean, I know people who've tried to quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better‚Äî;;sustain;;
78;high;asthma management;46;therapist;Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-;reflection;;;
78;high;asthma management;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;48;therapist;And-and it's hard to replace it with something.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;49;client;Yeah, it is. Um.;;sustain;;
78;high;asthma management;50;therapist;So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?;question;;;
78;high;asthma management;51;client;Well, I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;52;therapist;Oh, that-that sounds like it would be great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house, you know- you know.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;53;client;Oh, absolutely. I never. Never.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;54;therapist;Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that certainly would help.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;55;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;56;therapist;Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;57;client;Yeah. [chuckles];;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;58;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;59;client;It's really difficult.;;sustain;;
78;high;asthma management;60;therapist;So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-;reflection;;;
78;high;asthma management;61;client;Mm-hmm.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;62;therapist;-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergenc;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;63;client;Oh, really?;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;64;therapist;Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;65;client;Oh, that's great-;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;66;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
78;high;asthma management;67;client;-because that's always scary when she has to use that one.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;68;therapist;Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;69;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
78;high;asthma management;70;therapist;Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works.;therapist_input;;;
78;high;asthma management;71;client;Okay.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;72;therapist;Okay?;question;;;
78;high;asthma management;73;client;That sounds good. Thank you.;;change;;
78;high;asthma management;74;therapist;All right. Good.;other;;;
79;high;managing life;0;client;Something clicked, I'd had a bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew I'd messed up. I totally messed up.;;neutral;;
79;high;managing life;1;therapist;How did you know you messed up?;question;;;
79;high;managing life;2;client;Because I was- because I was right there, man. I was right there in the same place when I'd come home and I'd pop a couple of those pills, it was the same deal, like and I wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay exactly right there. And I just felt like I'd ruined everything. You know, Erin's using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but I kinda felt ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel that way again.;;change;;
79;high;managing life;3;therapist;Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at risk? Is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt bad talking to Erin on the phone?;reflection;;;
79;high;managing life;4;client;Because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I mean I could have stayed, I could have got, I could have got absolutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week.;;change;;
79;high;managing life;5;therapist;So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.;reflection;;;
79;high;managing life;6;client;But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right there, that's where I wanted to stay, you know? Anyway, I just, uh-- [crosstalk].;;change;;
79;high;managing life;7;therapist;Here you are actually, three months on, three long months as you say, um, and things have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of‚Äî;reflection;;;
79;high;managing life;8;client;They're better, yeah.;;change;;
79;high;managing life;9;therapist;Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for.;reflection;;;
79;high;managing life;10;client;Yeah, yeah.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Jean, it's good to see you again.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Hello, doctor.;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?;question;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I did what we discussed. I did the journal-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;5;client;-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if I could stop the urge-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;7;client;-and I found it was okay. It got a little bit scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on coming-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;9;client;to have a cigarette.;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;11;client;But during the week, I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's just in one week. So-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking.;reflection;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?;question;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Yes.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?;therapist_input;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;17;client;It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Right.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;19;client;-and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day-;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;21;client;-instead of at work. And I found that, um, it was really hard to stop those urges.;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-;reflection;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?;question;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;25;client;But I marked it in the book. Uh, that's one thing I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;In marking it down, okay.;reflection;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;27;client;So, I'm gonna have to really be aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Okay. So, and you've thought about already, what you might do, such as getting a hobby. Any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this?;question;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;29;client;If I can just postpone it-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;31;client;"-and-and say, ""Okay, I'm not gonna have it at home-";;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Right.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;33;client;"-I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work.""";;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Right.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;35;client;'Cause I-I-I-;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;37;client;And then, uh-uh, what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?;therapist_input;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;39;client;I think I'd just like to do what I did this first week. I liked the idea of marking it down.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay, so you can continue with that.;therapist_input;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;41;client;I-- And it took me a week and I'm down two cigarettes a day, I-I figure.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;43;client;What I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes, in other words, another three a day.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;45;client;And, um, 'cause I smoke a large pack and small pack, maybe just two small packs.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;You said five cigarettes this time.;therapist_input;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Yes.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?;question;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;49;client;I can try each day to count.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;Right.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;51;client;And I'm still gonna try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58];other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;53;client;So, if I [unintelligible 00:02:59] between two of them-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;55;client;-and also coming back and-and talking to you really helps 'cause I have someone to-;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;56;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;57;client;discuss it with.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;58;therapist;So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this?;question;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;59;client;I wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and-and a week, I can handle a week.;;change;;
80;high;smoking cessation;60;therapist;Absolutely. Okay.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;61;client;Okay, thank you doctor.;;neutral;;
80;high;smoking cessation;62;therapist;Good. So, we'll see you in a week.;other;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;63;client;Yes, thank you.;;neutral;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Did you like how your parents raised you?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;therapist;Tell me about how your parents raised you?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Tell me about how you've been feeling?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Okay. I guess I've been getting bigger.;;neutral;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Mm, what's that like for you?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Uh, scary I guess.;;sustain;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?;reflection;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him.;;neutral;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;I know you want me to see the doctor, I haven't called yet.;;sustain;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;I don't know. It seems overwhelming to me.;;sustain;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;What about it seems overwhelming?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Well, I hate making phone calls and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there and I hate needles.;;sustain;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical people?;reflection;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;How can I help you with these things?;question;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Can you help me make the call?;;change;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Sure, we can do that together.;other;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;Can you go with me to the appointment.;;change;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;I can try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending.;therapist_input;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol and the contraception?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. So we're working on a 10 point of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very important. One being not confident, one being very confident. So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what risk limits?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;I would say an eight.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;I would say a four.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Amount of four.;reflection;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. And so let's look at those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels and you remember what those are?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this point.;;change;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So that also helps me.;;change;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?;reflection;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. Anything else?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Nope.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I would say an eight.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Every time,-;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Every time.;therapist_input;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;probably a six.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Correctly as it's prescribed.;therapist_input;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Probably a six.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm-- I drank too much and I don't really care too much.;;change;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-;reflection;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here.;reflection;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?;question;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Before I leave?;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Yes.;other;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. And if you need more information, we can get that for you.;therapist_input;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay.;other;;;

83;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;It's a bit of a bitch.;;neutral;;

83;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;One of the, um, things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?;therapist_input;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;Um, I hope that it says that I want to, um, make some changes.;;change;;

83;high;adhering to medical procedure;55;client;It's really important.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;56;therapist;Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;57;client;It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because I'm, uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I'm not a bad person.;;sustain;;

83;high;adhering to medical procedure;61;client;If it means say, I can have my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I want.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;62;therapist;Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;63;client;Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;64;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;65;client;'Cause I'm-- Yeah.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;66;therapist;Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;67;client;Um, oh, my mom.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;68;therapist;Yeah. Your is mum still down south?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;70;therapist;Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;71;client;No.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;72;therapist;So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes.;reflection;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;73;client;Yeah, I am.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;74;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;75;client;I just, um, I don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know.;;sustain;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;76;therapist;So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;77;client;Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately fuck things up for myself.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;78;therapist;Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;79;client;No, this is important to me.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;80;therapist;Right.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;81;client;I have, um, I've-- it's important to me.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;82;therapist;Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?;therapist_input;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;83;client;I, um, I'm separated at the moment from my missus and-;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;84;therapist;What was-- what was your partner's name?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;85;client;Uh, Kirsty.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;86;therapist;Kristy.;reflection;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;87;client;I would- I would love f-f-for her to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't give a shit right now actually.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;88;therapist;Right. In terms of your employer, would they be supportive?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;89;client;Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;90;therapist;Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;91;client;Uh, I don't know.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;92;therapist;Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;93;client;I'm pretty much by myself up here.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;94;therapist;Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program.;therapist_input;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;95;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;96;therapist;The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?;therapist_input;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;97;client;Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;98;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;99;client;-that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;100;therapist;Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?;therapist_input;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;101;client;Yeah, let's give it some thought.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;102;therapist;Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?;reflection;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;103;client;Yeah. That'll definitely be true.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;104;therapist;Your family is down south. I mean,who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;105;client;Uh, I have a good relationship with my mum,-;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;106;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;107;client;with my brothers and sisters.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;108;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;109;client;My mum is actually pretty important to me.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;110;therapist;Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-what might that be like for her to hear?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;111;client;I think she'd be proud of me.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;112;therapist;Yeah. All right.;other;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;113;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;114;therapist;Brothers and sisters, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;115;client;Yeah. Yeah. A good, uh, good family.;;neutral;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;116;therapist;Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work together?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;117;client;Um, I don't know. Um, have some-somebody just to listen.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;118;therapist;And, um, I‚Äôm just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;119;client;She would- she would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could do it.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;120;therapist;Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;121;client;For them to have a father they can look up to.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;122;therapist;I‚Äôm getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.;reflection;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;123;client;It is what I want. Definitely.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;124;therapist;So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your whƒÅnau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might be now?;question;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;125;client;If I had their support of my-my family and [silence] I want to say that would be higher. I just know I fucked it up in the past. If they were there to support me now, then I‚Äôd be 99% sure.;;change;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;126;therapist;That's a huge move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your family on board, getting your whƒÅnau on board is going to be really important for us.;reflection;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;127;client;Yeah.;;change;;
86;high;reducing drug use;0;client;I just feel helpless about this whole deal.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;You're hopeless about what's going on.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Mm. I just feel helpless about this whole deal.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;You seem at a loss of where to go from here.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;4;client;No one wants to help me.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;You feel like people aren't willing to help.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;6;client;No one wants to help me.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;You feel alone.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;8;client;Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;You realize it's something you shouldn't have done.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;10;client;Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;You're feeling regretful.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;12;client;Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;Uh, it's something that just happened.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;14;client;I couldn't help myself.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;You're nervous that you've lost control of your behaviors.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;16;client;It's actually been a fabulous week.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;You've really had a good week.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;18;client;It's actually been a fabulous week.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;You seem excited about that.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;20;client;Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;You definitely know how to make good decisions.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;22;client;I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;You know that, um, positive peer influences have been helpful for you.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;24;client;Mm-hmm. I'm letting the whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;You feel like you're letting your family down.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;26;client;Mm-hmm. I'm letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;27;therapist;You feel like you've been a disappointment for them.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;28;client;Mm-hmm. This is not what I want for my life.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;29;therapist;This is not what you've envisioned.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;30;client;This is not what I want for my life.;;neutral;;
86;high;reducing drug use;31;therapist;You're willing to take steps to improve on that.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;32;client;Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.;;sustain;;
86;high;reducing drug use;33;therapist;You don't want to be here.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;34;client;I really want to get off the program.;;sustain;;
86;high;reducing drug use;35;therapist;You seem motivated to follow the rules.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;36;client;Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.;;sustain;;
86;high;reducing drug use;37;therapist;It's something that's always on your mind.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;38;client;I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.;;sustain;;
86;high;reducing drug use;39;therapist;It takes a lot of, um, strength to still not smoke, even though you're still craving.;reflection;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;40;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So let me tell you what I normally do in this, um, this interview, and we-we'll talk for up to maybe 20 minutes or so. Normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-;therapist_input;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;-and then we just talk together about that. So, um, but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start as well.;therapist_input;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Um, yeah, I, [sigh] that, I mean, like, when I was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I mean, I guess I don't really think about, like, you know, the drinking being, like, this huge deal and I don't-;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;-ever really think about, like-like, how much I drink.;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, and, like, fi- like filling out, like, how much I'm drinking every day, it was like, whoa, you know-;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Hm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;-like, I just didn't ever really think about it, like, that I was-- like, if I try to actually count the drinks, it's, kind of, a lot, I mean, it's, kind of, a lot.;;change;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;You were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns.;reflection;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, yeah, 'cause, like, I also, kind of, thought that, like, I drink, like, about as much as my friends did and then, like, I went back and I was, like, talking to my roommate about it and I was, like, telling her that, you know, I was drinking, like, like 10 drinks on the weekends, like, including Thursday, so like, Thursday, Friday-;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Hm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;-Saturday, Sunday.;;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;"And then she was like, ""Sarah, that's cra-- Like, that is crazy. Why are, you know, like, where are you drinking this?"" And I was- I was like, ""Well, you know, like, different places."" And I-I guess, like, I don't know, my friends didn't, like, know. Anyway, it's, yeah, I don't know.";;neutral;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah, this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it, she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you- as you realized when you did the questionnaire.;reflection;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, and yeah, I guess it was just like, I thought that everybody was, like, doing it, you know-;;change;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;-but that's not really what was going on. [chuckles];;change;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Yeah, the fact that your drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before?;reflection;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah.;;change;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah, so, that was the thing that, like, was really the most weird about doing those-;;change;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;forms.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;0;client;For me.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;1;therapist;So, um, everyone that comes on the South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;2;client;Um, I have to start getting the school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;3;therapist;Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;4;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;5;therapist;Okay. What a great goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;6;client;Uh, so people will get off my back.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;7;therapist;And who are these people?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;8;client;My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and I don't want to go back in.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;9;therapist;So that's something you definitely wanna avoid?;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;10;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;11;therapist;Okay. So getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;12;client;I will try.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;13;therapist;So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;14;client;I can't ever get up in the morning. So that's hard and then by the time I do get up, and then I get ready and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find a ride. So it could be a bunch of different reasons why I'm late.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;15;therapist;Okay, so it's not just one major thing?;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;16;client;No.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;17;therapist;So knowing that a couple of things can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;18;client;Get up on time would probably be a good start of making me get there on time.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;19;therapist;What time would you need to get up then?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;20;client;[sighs] If I'm gonna catch the bus I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause I go to bed so late and I don't know if I can do it.;;sustain;;
88;high;compliance with rules;21;therapist;So you're still kind of unsure if this is something that you could do yet you're saying you really wanna do it because you don't wanna go back for sanctions.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;22;client;Right. I could try-;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;23;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;24;client; and see how it goes.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;25;therapist;Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it?;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;26;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;27;therapist;So what time would you have to go to bed at night to make sure you're up by 6:15?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;28;client;I go about midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;29;therapist;Okay. Okay, so you're willing to go to bed at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;30;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;31;therapist;When would be a great day for you to start this?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;32;client;Uh, either tomorrow or the next day.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;33;therapist;Okay, so if I would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? Tomorrow or the next day?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;34;client;Let's start tomorrow.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;35;therapist;Tomorrow. Okay, great. So who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;36;client;My mom.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;37;therapist;Your mom.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;38;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;39;therapist;Okay. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;40;client;[sighs] She can after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I have to do it.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;41;therapist;"So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class"".";reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;42;client;Exactly. Yup.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;43;therapist;Great. What could maybe get in the way of you not getting up by 6:15?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;44;client;[sighs] Not going to bed on time.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;45;therapist;Not going to bed on time.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;46;client;Yup, that's gonna be a struggle for me.;;sustain;;
88;high;compliance with rules;47;therapist;Okay. So if you are feeling tempted to stay up later-;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;48;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;49;therapist; how could you respond instead?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;50;client;Just go to bed and turn off the lights, don't have my phone.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;51;therapist;Okay, so a phone is a distraction for you. So keeping your phone away-;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;52;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;53;therapist;- and even actually turning the lights off and making sure that it's dark?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;54;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;55;therapist;Kind of a reminder it's time to go to bed.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;56;client;Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;57;therapist;And-and also the support of your mom too.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;58;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;59;therapist;Great. So how will you know that you-your plan is working?;question;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;60;client;When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;61;therapist;So for you being in your class, when that bell rings, then you know, this is the goal.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;62;client;Absolutely.;;neutral;;
88;high;compliance with rules;63;therapist;So what I've been hearing so far- what again, what a great goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't having- like having all these extra people checking up on you and all those things.You've already have a plan of going to bed by 11:00, turning off the lights, putting your cell phone away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that seems really early in the morning, but you seem willing to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;64;client;Well, yeah, I hope so.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;65;therapist;What a great plan and you said you're going to start tomorrow.;reflection;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;66;client;I'll give it a try.;;change;;
88;high;compliance with rules;67;therapist;Great. Well, thank you.;other;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;68;client;You're welcome.;;neutral;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Tommy, I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party, and, you know, you're such a good kid. Like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's going to ruin your life.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Um, I mean, it was just the, like a social gathering. It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the drinks were there and I-- all my friends were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that I like do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes.;;sustain;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really, really concerns me.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;I-I get what you're coming from, but I-I-I really did. I-I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone. I-I didn't want to be, um, how do I put this? Like, I want it to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much.;;neutral;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. Like, think about it, think about all the things that can happen to you.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. I-I understand exactly what you're saying. And‚Äî;;neutral;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;How much are you drinking?;question;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;I-I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the‚Äî;;sustain;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Is it like every weekend?;question;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Every other weekends, I would say.;;neutral;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?;question;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Um, I-I guess I can. I-I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I-I do get you're coming from and‚Äî;;change;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yeah. Is-- are your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you were partying with?;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself. I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to-- just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.;;neutral;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and-and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Mm. Yeah. I-I-I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to-to a certain degree. And I-- it does make a lot of sense. And I-I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking that‚Äî;;change;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;I think you really need to quit.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah. I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me, wherever I go and parties and stuff that. I-I kind of feel like I should just, uh, get used to it or at least understand its, uh, its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't- I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.;;neutral;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, um, I wish you would quit. If all you're going to do is cut down, that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yeah. I-I-I just-- I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but I'm‚Äî;;sustain;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Do you wanna wait for that happen? Do you wanna wait for a dramatic experience?;question;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;You're-you're right. I-I don't want- I don't wanna be too far gone before it's too late. Like I-I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I-I guess I've never really had any-any real experience where the alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.;;change;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking.;therapist_input;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah. I-I think that that would be a good step forward into-- and a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true- the true aspects of life rather than the-the haziness of alcohol.;;change;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay, sounds good.;other;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Good morning, doctor.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;How can I help you today?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Yes.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;5;client;And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Right.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;7;client;So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;9;client;A respirologist.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;11;client;I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;13;client;I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.;;sustain;;
91;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;19;client;I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;21;client;I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked.;;sustain;;
91;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand.;;sustain;;
91;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Right.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;29;client;"I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.""";;sustain;;
91;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;31;client;That's right.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Okay. Is there anything I missed?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-;;sustain;;
91;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;35;client;-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Right.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;37;client;The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard-;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;39;client;-have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;41;client;I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;43;client;Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;45;client;I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;49;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;51;client;It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Definitely most important.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;53;client;Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;55;client;Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;56;therapist;35-40%. Okay.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;57;client;Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;58;therapist;Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;59;client;Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So-;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;60;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;61;client;-this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;62;therapist;Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?;question;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;63;client;Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;64;therapist;So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;65;client;I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;66;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;67;client;Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;68;therapist;Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?;therapist_input;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;69;client;In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;70;therapist;That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.;therapist_input;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;71;client;Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;72;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;73;client;-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;74;therapist;Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?;therapist_input;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;75;client;No, that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week.;;change;;
91;high;smoking cessation;76;therapist;Excellent. Well, thank you so much for coming in today.;reflection;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;77;client;Thank you for seeing me, doctor.;;neutral;;
91;high;smoking cessation;78;therapist;You're welcome.;other;;;
93;high;managing life;0;therapist;So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;1;client;I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later.;;change;;
93;high;managing life;2;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah, I think so.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;4;therapist;Great. So tell me a little bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable and stressed. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;5;client;Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like, I think if I am more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also.;;change;;
93;high;managing life;6;therapist;Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;8;therapist;Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?;question;;;
93;high;managing life;9;client;Hmm, I'd say I'm about an eight.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;12;therapist;Uh, why didn't you pick a six?;question;;;
93;high;managing life;13;client;Well, like I said, I just, I've identified like a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I were to be more active and I definitely wanna have that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of those things I think are what's really driving that- that rating.;;change;;
93;high;managing life;14;therapist;Okay. You're noticing there- there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence.;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;16;therapist;Am I missing anything else?;question;;;
93;high;managing life;17;client;I don't think so.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;18;therapist;Okay. Those are the big ones for you.;reflection;;;
93;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;20;therapist;Fantastic. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-;therapist_input;;;
93;high;managing life;21;client;Mm-hmm, yeah.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;22;therapist;- and- and what activities you might end up, um, choosing.;other;;;
93;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, that'd be great.;;neutral;;
93;high;managing life;24;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Good, so, um, we're here today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you'd like to talk about it.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to do something, um, such as move out of my house.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a little bit more about it so I understand it a little bit more.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Well, I-I offered my home to somebody and, uh, for, you know, uh, a transitional period.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;You know, and it seems that, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, the, uh, transitional period is- has come and it's beginning to time to transition. So.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;So that's a really kind thing of you to do to take someone into your home like that when they need help like that. And, um, but right now, you're thinking that, uh, time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to have him or her move out and have your place back to yourself.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah, that's, it's absolutely right that I want, I-I want change but I'm not, I am kind of, like, weak in that area where it's, like, the ability to actually say the words. You're right, yeah. I'd like to be able to do that.;;change;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. And what would, uh, what would help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?;question;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Um. [sighs] I don't know, I'm-I'm, I guess, I'm kind of, um, I care about the person and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I guess I am at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of having a companion and the other part of me is just, you know-- I-I cannot-- I am not really sure what I wanna do, you know.;;sustain;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. So you kind of feel two ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and in knowing he's around.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yeah, you know, it's kind of, like, the old sock- song saying hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more. [laughs] And‚Äî;;change;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;But you're not quite ready if you wanna sing that song.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;[laughs] Well, first of all I think he would hit the road if I started singing that song 'cause I can sing. [laughs];;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;I thought you did a pretty nice job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate, I also appreciate your sense of humor in-in doing that.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, you know, I'd be like where's the news. [laughs] I mean, it's either‚Äî;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;That really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Yeah, yeah, I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- What I've heard about comedians is that they are really not always that happy and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah. [laughs] I kind of, maybe I should go into that. [laughs] Like this girl‚Äî;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;Your new career.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know she's-she's, uh, got a serious job and she kind of does that on the side. [laughs];;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out of the house?;question;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;Mm. Let's see. Well, you know, I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that. Um.;;neutral;;

94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;therapist;Some guilt?;question;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;client;Yeah, yeah. Maybe some guilt and I, um, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a little bit, you know.;;sustain;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;therapist;Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're- because you're a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help people out.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;client;Yeah, I-I- yeah. I mean I- thank you. I-I-I appreciate you saying that I'm a good person. Like I feel I am. Um‚Äî;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;therapist;But you've done your duty. Duty is done.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;client;Yeah. Oops, it's just hard to- it's just hard to, um, er, yeah. I- my j- my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have to be a little bit more assertive, I think, and a little bit more, um, sure of myself.;;change;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;therapist;And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?;question;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;client;Well, um, I've had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but I'm-I'm just making, you know, 'cause I happen to sometimes just like hold things in. And then finally I- at-at one point I was really, you know, very logical about it. And then the other day I kind of got not so logical about it.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;client;[laughs];;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;therapist;So, uh, you were telling me earlier though that you've talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to go to.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;client;Yeah. That's the good thing that he does. And I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;client;And that gives me a relie- a sense of relief. Like I'm not just, you know, saying yeah. You know, go find your own place or, you know, I mean, there are places where he has a safety net to go to and that-that is something that I think I feel better about and that it makes it easier to discuss and giving them options that he can-- Yeah, yeah, exactly.;;change;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;therapist;So, you might have to literally like pack his bags and help them get to those places, um.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;client;Been there, done that. [laughs];;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;therapist;Okay. Are you-- This is something you've done before.;reflection;;;

94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;client;Well, um, I told him within a couple of days is, you know. I think, um, I-I- cause I have future plans, um, and some things that are up in the air with me as far as where I'm going to be living in. I've had this place for seven years, but I'm not sure, you know. Every day is a new- a new, uh, winding road that we go down, you know?;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;therapist;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;client;Um.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;therapist;And it's kind of scary.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;client;Oh, God, yeah, yeah. But, you know, and it's scary to have an extra, a huge extra trunk that you have to carry with you [chuckles].;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;50;therapist;And he's that extra trunk.;reflection;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;51;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;52;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;53;client;But I-I mean and it's not that I don't care about him, I do. But you know, it's just like, we're both- we're all adults here, come on.;;change;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;54;therapist;Okay. All right. So, it sounds like you-you've actually worked this out until be out within a couple of days.;reflection;;;

94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;56;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;57;client;And I don't know what his plans are, but those are my plans.;;change;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;58;therapist;Okay. Well, I have a funny feeling your plans will prevail. [laughter];other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;59;client;I like your way of thinking, girl. I-I'll tell him that. [laughs].;;neutral;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;60;therapist;Well, thanks for-for talking and playing with our little things here.;other;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;61;client;Thank you;;neutral;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Right. Hi, Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?;question;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, okay. Just, I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just so stupid. I'm such an idiot. I didn't know what the point of-of this is. I just- I just keep doing the same thing over and over, even though I know it can kill me. I just, I don't have any more willpower, ma'am. Yeah, [foreign language].;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Well, Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. And you're saying that you're just tired. You've lost all your willpower.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;You don't want to continue.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out. And I just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], I'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;So you feel really, really like you've had it up to here.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Yeah. You're-you're tired. You're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Yes. Sometimes a pain in-in the body. It's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;So you were in a lot of pain?;question;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yes. I am.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;I'm sorry about that. It must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is to cry.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Yeah, yeah, suicide.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;It's okay, Ruth. I understand. Pain inside.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;[foreign language];;neutral;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;So your mom doesn't understand you and you don't have a dad, that's around?;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Yeah, 'cause she's a single mom and she struggles a lot. I wanna help her, but I can't help her. So it just makes me sad. I feel like if I don't live anymore, she'll be okay. And she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my stuff.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;So you feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;I-I think so?;;neutral;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;How is she gonna be better off without you?;question;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;Because it won't be a burden to her.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;therapist;And how are you a burden now?;question;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;client;Because she has to pay for my food and my uniforms, um, to have a roof over our heads.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;therapist;And how do you help her now?;question;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;client;Um, I try to be a good kid. I tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes.;;change;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;therapist;Okay. So then even by you coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain that you feel, that is you trying to help yourself out in one way or another. And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier. That shows me that you care about her so, so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;client;That's the right one.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;therapist;-How could it be the right one? Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single parent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? B;question;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;client;Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I can.;;sustain;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;therapist;You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can and it's normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those things and we can help you.;reflection;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;client;Thank you, ma'am, I feel better.;;change;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;therapist;Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today.;other;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I'm doing what I'm told.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Uh, no.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper. So-;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, and I, you know, I-I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and, you know, things that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah. You know, I've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my argument.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, which is that, um, I'm going to do what I- do what I wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here anyway. So-;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Nope. I never have been.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;"Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from friends.""";reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;"""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong.""";reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Mm-hmm. I think so.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;You're not sure if he's sort of playing things up a little bit there?;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah. I mean, you know-;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;It might be a bit extreme to-;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;-to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?;therapist_input;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Like right now?;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Uh-;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Uh, yeah, I guess.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?;therapist_input;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Well, you know, I've-I've heard these kinds of things before, but I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;It's the same thing.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;to con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through alcohol?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah. It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know people who haven't had any problems. Um, so that's about the extent.;;sustain;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Mm-hmm. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;So I can't really- I don't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way that I look at it.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;"You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-";;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;I never get that information.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and‚Äî;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;That was something that you'd been planning?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yep.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. That's a big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a good parent.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Mm. What does being a good parent look like? Tell me more about that.;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, not-not like being there at home with them, not being absent, um, taking care of them, feeding them, um, changing their diaper, which I'm not excited about. Um, you know, kind of the- those basics.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Hmm. Kind of like protecting your baby and-;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;-guiding your baby and-;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;-you know, nurturing that baby is really important to you-;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;and raising your baby well?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Yeah, of course.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;That's something that- that really matters to you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the information that's in the brochure.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;What do you make about that- what do you think about that?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, well, I just don't know- I just don't know where-where these brochures get their information or-or anything from, like, where's the hard evidence essentially.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;You wanna see it in black and white.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thing. Um, this is information that, uh, that I have been sharing with you earlier, this is the latest information evidence-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has gone into what is-what is okay for a mom to consume, like, alcohol. There's the-the evidence that we have, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?;therapist_input;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Um, well, it surprises me that that's based on research from out of 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess, you know, if it is, um, you know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have to-I make that decision, um, but, um, that's a lot of, uh, information to take in today.;;change;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Mm-hmm, kind of feels like, you know, you were making some really good decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this information isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Nope.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps, like when you think about maybe moving away from drinking alcohol throughout the rest of your pregnancy?;question;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Um, well, first things first, if I could take a brochure home maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-and get-get their support, um, I think that's really gonna help me, and kind of changing our-our habits, or, you know, putting the alcohol away, out of sight. Um, I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today when I get home.;;change;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you're talking about. You're talking about putting the alcohol away, that's huge. That's-that's really big steps.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;I really want to thank you for, you know, exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- giving you a chance to do some more research and, you know, maybe looking through these brochures and kind of just coming back and sharing a little bit more about, you know, what you thought about the information and what feels right for you. Is that something you'd be open to?;therapist_input;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Yeah, I think that- I think that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, like, ways to approach it because I think that my partner kind of has the same view that I- that I had. So-;;change;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;We definitely can cover that again on our next meeting. Thank you for coming to see me.;reflection;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;Yeah. Thank you.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Well, Mr. Smith, that's your medication sorted out.;therapist_input;;;

97;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;Okay. I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight.;question;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;What?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight.;question;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;You are joking, aren't you? I mean, look, I've made time in my day to come here.;;sustain;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;I'm kept in your waiting room-;;neutral;;

97;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;-for 45 minutes.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;It's not acceptable.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;You know?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;If I make an appointment with a client for 10:00-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;-I expect them to start at 10:00, not 10:45.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Right, and you-- so you're busy enough, and‚Äî;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Yeah, I've got other things to do. I've got accounts to do.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;I've got clients they're coming in.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;You know?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;And it wasn't essentially easy for you to make the time to come down, and you had to wait in the waiting room, and now I raised the subject of weight just when you're thinking of going.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Yeah, I mean, okay, fair enough, um, I've got to have my blood pressure-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;-medication changed, but I really haven't got time to talk about my weight. I mean, you know, I'm aware of my weight.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;Right.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;I'm aware of the problems, and I'm also aware of the solutions.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;Right.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Um, so I don't really need a discussion, it's- it's just I've got too much to do at the moment, you know?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;Right. And so it-it-it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;36;therapist;And, I- I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting room.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;37;client;Well, it's b- it's bad form, you know?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;38;therapist;Yeah, yeah, that's, um, and that- that's not easy for you, because you- you'd like to go really soon, and here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;39;client;Yeah, but basically I've got things to do.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;40;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;41;client;I gotta get back to the office.;;neutral;;

97;high;diet and weight loss management;44;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;45;client;-that I've gotta deal with.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;46;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;47;client;And every time- every moment out of my day-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;48;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;49;client;-means that I have to work in the evening-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;50;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;51;client;or the weekends.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;52;therapist;Yeah. It counts.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;53;client;Well, when you're self-employed, you haven't got a choice, you know?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;54;therapist;Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's up to you, just a couple of minutes.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;55;client;Well, I'm here now, so yeah, okay, if it's a couple of minutes, yeah?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;56;therapist;I promise.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;57;client;Okay, because I really must get on.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;58;therapist;I want- I wanted to simply ask you how you feel about it?;question;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;59;client;About what-what, losing weight? Well, obviously, I-I want to.;;change;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;60;therapist;Yep.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;61;client;Um, yeah, I mean, who doesn't? I mean, I'm aware that I'm over my, uh, uh, b-b-b-balance weight, but I now know that it's causing problems. I mean, obviously, I get out of breath if I have to do something a bit howering, and I realize that I'm on this blood pressure-;;change;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;62;therapist;Right.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;63;client;-um, and-and maybe that's probably contributing to it.;;change;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;64;therapist;Right. So you can see the links between your weight and your health, and you'd like things to be a bit better.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;65;client;Yeah, I mean, there are rather other things, but I mean, yeah, the weight is a- is a- is a- something I would like to get hold off. You get on [inaudible 00:03:17];;change;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;66;therapist;You'd like to, if you could?;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;67;client;"Yeah, I mean, I know, um, th- the theories of bit of exercise on a regular basis, um, a balanced diet. Um, but unfortunately, because of my lifestyle, because of being self-employed as an accountant, it's finding the time, uh, to exercise, but also, finding the time to sort of think, ""Okay, I'm gonna go shopping for this, that, and the other""-";;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;68;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;69;client;"""I'm gonna prepare a meal.""";;change;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;70;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;71;client;With me, it's very often‚Äî;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;72;therapist;Ready meals, and that sort of thing.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;73;client;Yeah, yeah. Food on the run, you know?;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;74;therapist;Okay, yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;75;client;Grazing.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;76;therapist;Let me see if I can summarize what you've said, um, and then we'll see what next. Um, you lead a busy life.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;77;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;78;therapist;Um, you run a business, and you've got a lot to do.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;79;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;80;therapist;Yeah. Um, you're- you're- you're aware of the- of the links between your health and your weight, and you are concerned, to some extent, about that, and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it, it's just that your life is busy and rushed, and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;81;client;Yeah, I mean, I, to a certain extent, because of my lifestyle, food is just fuel.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;82;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;83;client;You know? Um, because I'm juggling all these balls, and I don't want to drop any.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;84;therapist;I get it. I get it. And so, if you could fit it in, you would like things to be different, but that's not so easy.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;85;client;No.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;86;therapist;Okay. Can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this?;question;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;87;client;Um, okay, I'm up for that, but it's gonna be the same problem of, A, finding time-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;88;therapist;Right.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;89;client;-and B, if I can make an appointment-;;neutral;;

97;high;diet and weight loss management;92;therapist;Exactly.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;93;client;-or whatever, 'cause it's‚Äî;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;94;therapist;Exactly. I'll tell you what might be a nice solution, is if you come down first appointment, and I give you an appointment at 8:30-;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;95;client;That'd be good.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;96;therapist;- and then there'll be absolutely no waiting. And, the purpose of that- of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward, and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life that you've got.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;97;client;I'll maybe have a look at my schedule, see whether anything-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;98;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;99;client;-can be arranged, or I can pass something on-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;100;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;101;client;-to something on to some-- and-and so it's not a wasted interview. So I can come here and say, okay, I've looked at my schedules, I've looked at things-;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;102;therapist;Good.;other;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;103;client;whatever.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;104;therapist;Good. And see if you can fix it up, and also give some thought to what we've talked about.;reflection;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;105;client;Yeah, of course.;;neutral;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;106;therapist;Good stuff. Okay.;other;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;3;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;Um, I wanted to ask you first how you're doing physically. Um, I wanna make sure you're okay, if you feel okay. And, um, 'cause your-your safety is of, uh, most importance. So, if I could just ask you a couple of questions-;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;5;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;-surrounding that, will that be okay?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;7;client;Absolutely. Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;-um, we-we're-- You're here probably because of your speeding ticket. That's what I gathered.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Yeah. I got a DUI, and I was speeding, uh, during the DUI, obviously.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Oh. Oh, okay. So, Um, around that, um, do you ever feel-- You feel bad or-or sick when you're-- Right now, is there something--;question;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;Do you feel okay. Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure, um, uh, and, um, if the last time you-you drank was--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;13;client;The night of the-the DUI is the last time I drank.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;Uh-huh, yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;15;client;And then, you know, um, I guess I'm here 'cause my lawyer wants me to go through an assessment-;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;17;client;-uh, with you, and, um, I'm really not sure what it means or anything like that, but, uh, he said I'm supposed to come here and, uh, just tell the truth, is what he told me.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;20;therapist;Um, and also, if there's any-any-any information that you need from me, please, um, feel free to ask. Um, that the reason that he asked you to come in was because of the blood alcohol level was 2.8.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;21;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;22;therapist;So, um, that was legally beyond the limit that you should be driving.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;23;client;Is it bad, or is it high or?;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;24;therapist;Well, it's-it's high, uh, you know, they--;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;25;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;26;therapist;For driving.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;27;client;Okay;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;28;therapist;And so, um, the officer at the- at the scene, um, when you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-- There was a- there was a problem.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;29;client;Yeah. He was, well, freaking out. He was--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;30;therapist;Was he freaking out? Yeah-yeah.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;31;client;I think he was getting a little over the top a little bit, but, you know, again, whatever.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;32;therapist;Right-right. So, um, I'll just ask you a couple of questions, um, if you don't mind about-about your drinking. And-and your-- So, um, you said the couple was two weeks ago was the last time you drank?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;33;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;34;therapist;Yeah. Okay. And, um, that night, what was it that you-you drank and, how much?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;35;client;Uh, my friend was having a, um- a get together as it was birthday party in, uh, downtown, and, uh, you know, it's not like it's a normal thing, but, uh, I did drink too much that night. You know, I just, uh-- And I used poor judgment. I shouldn't have driven that night.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;36;therapist;Right. Yeah. Um, I was-- Maybe, you could tell me about how much you drank.;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;37;client;Um, I don't really remember. I know, uh, I dunno, I probably had five or six drinks, I would think, something like that.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;38;therapist;Mm-hmm. Five, six drinks, like?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;39;client;Um, yeah, they were a little bigger than that. I don't really-- I wasn't really counting, so, I don't really know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;40;therapist;Oh, okay. So, I guests maybe five or six.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;41;client;Five or six, something like that. Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;42;therapist;Um, yeah. And-and, w-what were the drinks, were?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;43;client;Um, absolute vodka-;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;44;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;45;client;and seven off. Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;46;therapist;Oh, okay. So, um, you said that it was pretty much just five or six. Do you-- How often do you use that? And you said it's not a-;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;48;therapist;not a normal occasion for you to drink that much?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;49;client;Normally I drink one or two, and that's kind of it, you know, this one I did, uh- you know, I did feel a little drunk when I was- you know, when I was drinking, I just, uh, used poor judgment. I really shouldn't have drove.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;50;therapist;Right. Yeah. Um, so, you usually don't drink that much. Um, on an average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink? Just--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;51;client;Um, sometimes I drink, um, you know, maybe one or two, and then I- and then I won't drink for a while, you know. So, it's not really a-- There's not really a pattern-;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;52;therapist;Uh-huh;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;53;client;-you know, it's not really like a uh- it's not a habit, you know,;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;54;therapist;Right.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;55;client;I-I don't know if I would consider myself alcoholic. You know, I just, uh, um, you know, again, it was poor judgment.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;56;therapist;Right. So, it doesn't get in the way of your-;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;57;client;Oh, no.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;58;therapist;every day.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;59;client;Absolutely not. Mm-mm.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;60;therapist;Right. Oh, that's good.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;61;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;62;therapist;So, um, looking back, Mike, uh, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, um, most in your life?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;63;client;Um, there was really not a time that I, uh-- I don't know. I-I don't understand the question really. I mean, it-- There really wasn't-- I don't really drink on a normal basis, so, I don't know-- [crosstalk];;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;64;therapist;So, that is- that is a complete, uh-- A question that is even applicable?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;65;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;66;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;68;therapist;That's fine.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;70;therapist;That's fine. Okay. Um, so, what about the, uh- the first DUI, could you tell me a little bit about that? This was your second one?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;72;therapist;And so, that's sort of why I was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;73;client;It seems like every time that I, uh, do drink more than a couple of drinks, I tend to get in trouble. And, the two times that I did, I got in trouble both times. [crosstalk];;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;74;therapist;It was those two times. Yeah.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;75;client;Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's-- It sounds strange, I know, but, uh--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;76;therapist;It sounds like bad luck.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;77;client;Yeah. Actually, that-that's followed me around pretty much my whole life, the bad luck thing.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;78;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;79;client;But the-the-the-the-the alcohol hasn't really at all.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;80;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;81;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;82;therapist;But just that bad luck?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;83;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;84;therapist;Yeah. Is there alcohol with the- with-- Goes hand in hand with the bad luck or just--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;85;client;Sure seems like it. Yeah. It sure seems like that.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;86;therapist;Yeah. Oh, okay. So-so, what about that? The-- Is there other incidences that you could think of that seems, uh, um, alcohol was there, and then your luck just sorta took a-a turn, or it was just those two times?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;87;client;Um, you know, I don't really, um-- I-I don't really, uh, get into a situation where I-I-I drink too much. Um, you know, again, I-I realize it's my second DUI, but,, um, uh-uh, it isn't something that, um, is like a normal everyday process for me.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;89;client;Um, you know, normally when I drink, I drink one or two drinks and then I stop. Um, so, it's not like it's, um-- You know, it's not like it's something that has become a problem in my life, you know.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;90;therapist;Oh, good. Oh, good. And-and so, where do you usually, um, have your drinks? Is it at home or, uh, out-out for, uh- after work, social drinking?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;91;client;Um, it's normally social.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;93;client;Yeah. It's normally social. It would be, you know, maybe in events or something like that is normally when I would, um, maybe drink more than one or two.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;95;client;I guess I should probably just call a taxi cab or something, you know. That way, I wouldn't have this problem.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;96;therapist;Would that help?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;97;client;Um, probably, I think that would help. I think that would be something that I should, uh- I should work on.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;98;therapist;So, it sounds like you've already been thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around safely.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;99;client;Yeah. Yeah, or I can just stay home probably too. If I was gonna drink, I could probably stay home, then I wouldn't get in trouble either.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;100;therapist;You have been giving this a lot of thought.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;101;client;Yeah, a little bit.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;102;therapist;Yeah, good.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;103;client;Yeah, obviously, because I just don't-- You know, I don't like getting in trouble, and I don't, uh--;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;104;therapist;Trouble's not fun.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;105;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;

98;high;compliance with rules;107;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;108;therapist;Yeah. So, tell-tell me a little bit more about, um, when you fi-- If you'd find yourself, and then that-that thought comes about maybe doing something other than getting in the- in the car, does that come and go, or-or is it something that you think you-- Next time you might do?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;109;client;Um, oh, I'll never get in the car when I'm drinking again. That-- Yeah. I-I would never do that again.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;110;therapist;This, it-- What-what-what was different?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;111;client;Uh, I don't want to lose my license, you know.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;112;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;113;client;I don't, uh, you know, I don't wanna lose my license.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;114;therapist;Wow. You-you need your license-;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;115;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;116;therapist;to get around. you need your license for work.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;117;client;Well, and then I-I sell cars for a living too, so--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;118;therapist;Oh.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;119;client;-um, you know, that would be, um-- You know, I don't wanna lose my job either. You know, I think those would kind of be connected together.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;121;client;And, you know, I-- You're not gonna call my work or anything for this, are you?;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;122;therapist;No.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;123;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;124;therapist;No, no. That's--;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;125;client;All right.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;126;therapist;That would be entirely up to you, um, to-to have that.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;127;client;Okay. I just didn't know how that worked.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;128;therapist;Oh, no.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;129;client;Because I think if they found out, I might, you know, be in jeopardy with my job. So--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;130;therapist;Well, you're here. And-and-and I have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. It took a lot to come in today and, um, when, um- when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which I-I hear you saying, um, calling a taxi or-or staying home.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;131;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;132;therapist;So, what does staying home look like for you? Is that something that-- You know, you-you talked about drinking at an event. Would staying home be--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;133;client;Well, you know, the Super Bowl is coming up, and that might be an opportunity where, you know, I might-- I could see myself maybe drinking that day, you know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;134;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;135;client;So, maybe I would just, uh-- I think I'll just have people come over to my house instead of going somewhere else, you know.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;136;therapist;That would work for you?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;137;client;Yeah, I think so, and probably a smarter thing to do. I don't wanna go through this again, you know.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;138;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;139;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;140;therapist;Uh, so, uh, would people come and drink at your house, and then they would be fine with that?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;141;client;I think so.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;142;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;143;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;144;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;145;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;146;therapist;So, an event at your house.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;147;client;There you go.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;148;therapist;Yeah, good. That sounds good. Mike, has there even been, if any, um, a time in your life when you've thought about, um, not drinking at all?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;149;client;For my first DUI, I did, uh-- I didn't drink at all for about six months. And, um, I-I-I just didn't think that, um, I really had a problem with it, so, you know, I-I did start drinking again. But, you know, again, it wasn't uh-- You know, it was a little different last time, because I was drinking a little more last time than, you know, now. I don't really drink as-as much as I used to drink, you know, um, and, you know, after you know, I quit for six months, so I kind of knew that I didn't really have a problem.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;150;therapist;Right. Six months. That's a long time.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;152;therapist;What were those six months like for you?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;153;client;Um, I know it was kind of strange. My friends didn't really hang out with me too much. Um--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;154;therapist;Friends?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;155;client;Yeah. You know, I, uh.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;156;therapist;Whi-which? If you don't mind me asking, which friends were those? I don't mean to get too personal, but, the friends that normally drank with you or just your-;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;157;client;No, my friends.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;158;therapist;social circles. Okay.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;159;client;Just my social circle, I guess, uh--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;160;therapist;Wha-wha-what do you think made-made them n-not hang out with you?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;161;client;Probably 'cause I didn't- I wasn't drinking with them, I guess. I don't really know. I mean, it seemed, uh--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;162;therapist;Did you ask them?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;163;client;Um, no. I really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. You know? I mean, it was, uh-- She said that if I, you know, kept hanging out with them guys, that she wasn't gonna be with me anymore. And I just thought that it was better for me to, you know, calm down for a little bit and, uh, maybe things would get better with us, you know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;164;therapist;And your girlfriend's important to you-;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;165;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;166;therapist;and that relationship was important to you.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;167;client;Well, it was until she left, you know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;168;therapist;At the time it was important, yeah.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;169;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;170;therapist;Is it-- Why'd she leave?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;171;client;Uh, she left when I started drinking again.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;172;therapist;Oh, after the six months.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;173;client;After the six months, she, uh-- You know, it's kinda, I dunno, she just said that it wasn't gonna work out, and, uh, she decided not to continue with the relationship.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;174;therapist;Oh, okay. So-so, um, you started drinking again, and then she left?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;175;client;Uh, it was about the same time. I really don't know which came first. It was about the same time. Uh, we were getting in a lot of arguments. I just didn't quite feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My friends weren't around. I, uh-- You know, I missed going out with them.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;176;therapist;You felt isolated?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;177;client;Yeah. It was kind of weird 'cause I felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh- and uh, you know, I, uh-- And she was telling me what to do all the time, and I just, uh, didn't feel right about the whole situation. So, it was pretty much, we both decided, you know, that it just wasn't the right thing to do, so.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;178;therapist;And, so you're-you're an independent guy-;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;179;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;180;therapist;-and, no one's going to tell you what to do.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;181;client;Well, I guess. Sure. Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;182;therapist;Yeah. So, have, uh-- So then, you started drinking again, and that was-- If you could just kind of give me a little timeframe of how long ago that was, that-that six months of complete--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;183;client;[clear throat] Well, let's see. The first one was, uh, three years ago, and then, um, this one was a few weeks ago, so, um, it's been a few years, you know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;184;therapist;Absolutely. Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;185;client;Yeah. It's been a few years;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;186;therapist;So, in-in what ways has, uh, drinking, um, sort of, uh-- What is kind of the good things about drinking since those couple of- those couple of years, and then-then maybe not so good things?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;187;client;I don't really know that I can really compare good or bad. I just, uh-- You know, I just drink to be social, you know, I don't know that it really changes anything about me. It just, uh-- You know, I just drink to be social, you know.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;188;therapist;Mm-hmm. And those friends that were not hanging around with you, did they come back?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;189;client;Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. As soon as my girlfriend left, I could go out with them again, you know. [laughter];;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;190;therapist;Did they not get along with your girlfriend?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;191;client;Well, she didn't want me going out with them.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;192;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;193;client;She thought that they really--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;194;therapist;She was separate then from your other friends and-;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;195;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;196;therapist;-those relationships just didn't come together?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;197;client;She blamed the first DUI on them. She said, you know, because I was out with them, that it was pretty much, you know, they-they made me drink too much that night.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;198;therapist;And what do you think?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;199;client;I think she was right on that. Yeah, absolutely.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;200;therapist;So, you-you--;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;201;client;I mean, if they wouldn't have gave me those shots, you know, towards the end of the night, I would've been all right. You know, I could have drove, and I wouldn't have, uh- I wouldn't have hit that mailbox.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;202;therapist;You would have been fine if they didn't- if they didn't give you those-those shots. Yeah.;reflection;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;205;client;That was--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;206;therapist;first DUI that got you.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;207;client;Yeah. I was on-- It was like I was a couple of blocks away from the house and I, uh, rolled up on the neighbor's lawn and I took out their mailbox.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;208;therapist;That must have been scary.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;209;client;I don't really remember too much of that night.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;210;therapist;Oh, that was blackout type?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;211;client;Uh, I don't know if I was blacked out, but I just don't remember a lot of it.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;212;therapist;Right. Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;213;client;I wouldn't really call it a blackout. I just don't really-;;neutral;;

98;high;compliance with rules;226;therapist;Oh.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;227;client;I think she became a little too possessive at that point.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;228;therapist;Yeah. You felt like she was the only person that, um, you had in your life, you needed your friends and--;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;229;client;Um, I think she just wanted to control me and I was tired of being controlled.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;230;therapist;No one likes to be controlled, uh, yeah. Yeah.

98;high;compliance with rules;231;client;No, I was-- They just-- No, they weren't- they weren't really controlling me. They just-- They shouldn't have given me the last couple shots, 'cause you, they-they knew I was pretty, you know, uh, messed up before that. So-;;neutral;;

98;high;compliance with rules;233;client;-you know, that when they- when they-- You know, when they gave me the last, you know, couple shots, that kind of put me over the edge.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;234;therapist;Right, they weren't looking out for your best interest at that point.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;235;client;Pretty much, pretty much.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;236;therapist;And then sent you out in your car.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;237;client;Yeah. I mean I guess it was my decision to take the, uh- you know, the other shots, but I-I just-- I don't know. I really don't really remember too much.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;238;therapist;It's a hindsight again.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;239;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;240;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;241;client;Yeah. You can blame hindsight a little bit. I mean, that works for me. [laughter];;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;242;therapist;Hindsight? Oh, yeah, they'll-- it'll take the- it'll take the blame. Um, so, you still-- Do you still, uh, you know, you started drinking again, and then, um, the second DUI, what-- Is it the same circle of social-social circle, same friends?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;243;client;Yeah. [crosstalk];;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;244;therapist;Same type of situation. [crosstalk];reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;245;client;I mean, they've been my friends since, you know, uh, since high school.;;neutral;;

98;high;compliance with rules;247;client;Yeah, absolutely.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;248;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah. And-and sometimes, um, people have friends who are friends, but then there's friends who would stay on in our lives and are constant. So, these would be your constant core--;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;249;client;Sure, absolutely.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;250;therapist;Yeah, okay.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;251;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;252;therapist;Have you ever had, um, uh, interest outside, um, the social drinking, the friends, um, like, what do you do when you're not with them?;question;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;263;client;Well, I think I would like really think about--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;264;therapist;Since the co- the court sent you and we have to sort of explore what would happen if you went out and did this again.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;265;client;Yeah. Well, I mean I-I, uh- I, uh- I wouldn't drink as much, and if I- if I did, I would call, uh, a taxi or, um, you know, get some kind of a ride home, I think, 'cause, uh, you know, I just, uh-- I-I just don't wanna get in trouble, you know.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;266;therapist;Yeah. Is there somebody that you could call?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;267;client;Uh, I don't really think about that. I guess I would have to think about that, because if I was gonna go out and drink, I would have to think about that. Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;268;therapist;Right.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;269;client;I guess I could call it taxi cab or something, I don't know.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;270;therapist;They'll come.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;271;client;Yeah. I think that will be something.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;272;therapist;Yeah. They'll come. As long as you got the money, they'll come and get you. Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;273;client;Yeah. I think maybe if I take some money, I'll put it like in my wallet-;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;274;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;275;client;-and I'll like put it in there for emergency, and that way, I'll have money. In case I get drunk, I can just call a cab, and I'll use that money to get home.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;276;therapist;Oh, so, when you use your-your bar money, it would be somewhere else?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;277;client;What's that?;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;278;therapist;Your bar money would be somewhere else, not in your wallet?;question;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;280;therapist;There you go. Okay, yeah. So, that, y-yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;281;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;282;therapist;That makes- that makes a lot of sense. So then you'd have your money tucked away someplace different.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;283;client;Yeah. Well, if I put, uh- if I put it away, then I wouldn't spend it though, you know, [unintelligible 00:18:48] have it.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;284;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;285;client;There-there would be a plan that I would have to-;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;286;therapist;Sounds like a good plan.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;287;client;to get home. Yeah.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;288;therapist;Yeah. So, uh, how often do you think you'll be needing that plan in the--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;289;client;It'd probably be my wallet for a while, I would think, 'cause I-- Like I said, I don't really think I have a problem with, uh- with the drinking, you know. I just-;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;290;therapist;Right.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;291;client;-think that, you know, it was an isolated incident.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;292;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;293;client;And-and I, uh-- You know, I just, uh--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;294;therapist;And then-- Yeah, and then also you said if you're going to have people, uh, you're gonna be drinking for the Super Bowl. Was is it Super Bowl?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;295;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;296;therapist;I'm sorry, I'm not a football fan but it's Super Bowl coming up, right?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;297;client;Yeah, well, you gotta have some people over at the Super Bowl, you know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;298;therapist;So, you'd have them in and, um, I'm just curious about the folks who are leaving your house, would they-- Would-would you be concerned about them, there'll be a taxi. Sometimes designated drivers I--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;299;client;I don't really hang out with people that really drink a lot though. I mean, they're-they're not like-- I wouldn't call them drunks, so, I mean, they can, you know, they can handle their-- [crosstalk];;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;300;therapist;So, it would be up to them?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;301;client;Sure, I would think, yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;302;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;303;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;304;therapist;It sounds like you have-- You've thought about this, and you're-you're willing to put some things in place, the-the wallet, um, money in the wallet and-and for the taxi-;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;305;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;306;therapist;Have folks in to-to socialize for an event, and that you still have your-your social-- Your friends and your core group and-and, uh, just be careful. What was the six months of not drinking like for you? If you were to choose to not drink.;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;307;client;You know, it was a- it was, uh- it was pretty good. I just didn't feel like I had my friends around, and-and it just-- It seemed kinda boring. I mean, I felt good physically and, uh, you know, I, uh- I was more on time to work, I was doing really good at work and so forth, um, but, you know, it just, um-- The hard part for me was I just, uh- I just didn't have any friends around. I just kinda-- I felt isolated. I just didn't- I just didn't feel comfortable, you know.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;308;therapist;Six months is a- is a long time. There was, um-- Try to think back, were there- were there other people? Was it- was it just you?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;309;client;Well, my-my girl- my girlfriend and I were trying to work it out. But it just seemed like we were arguing all the time, you know. It just didn't seem like-- You know what I mean? Like the not-drinking part was good, but it just didn't seem like anything else had changed.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;310;therapist;All right.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;311;client;You know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;312;therapist;So-so, if you were not to-- If you were to go with the plan of maybe not drinking, which you mentioned-;reflection;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;318;therapist;Would there be something else that would, um, sort of, uh, fill in that-- The-the friends area, do you think?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;319;client;Well, I don't know. I mean, it's a-- I mean, my friends drink though. So, it's kinda hard to- it's kinda hard to, you know, to be with them, and then-- When I'm not drinking, 'cause it's-- I just don't feel like I fit in, you know.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;320;therapist;But, yeah, I-I see what-what you're saying, for sure. Um, there-there's those friends that they drink but they don't drink that much, I heard you saying.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;321;client;Yeah, they don't drink that much, but they-they seem to-- You know, like they do drink though, you know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;322;therapist;Mm. Sure.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;323;client;I mean, it's just beer. You know-;;neutral;;

98;high;compliance with rules;325;client;-it's not like they're drinking whiskey or anything like that. It's--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;326;therapist;Yeah. So--;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;327;client;You know, but, they'll drink beer, and it's just-- You know, for me, I don't know. Sometimes, uh, I don't-- You know, I have an intention to have a couple of drinks and maybe I'll have, you know, more than a couple, you know-;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;328;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;329;client;-and then I don't know what really makes a-a legal limit. So, I think I can drink what? Like two or three drinks an hour, is that what it is?;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;330;therapist;Um, it's one drink per hour.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;331;client;One drink per hour, okay.;;neutral;;

98;high;compliance with rules;341;client;That's it.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;342;therapist;Yeah. Uh, the, uh- the idea of, um, having the friends and not drinking, is that something that i-- Would be even, uh, a reality?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;343;client;Yeah, I guess. I-I think I probably know a couple of friends that don't drink and I don't really, uh, probably--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;344;therapist;Then, who are- who-who-who are they?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;345;client;I'd have to really think about it. I don't really have too many good friends. You know, I have some acquaintances that don't drink but-;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;346;therapist;Would it--;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;347;client;pretty much everyone I know like drinks.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;348;therapist;Yeah, so wha-what would-- What do you think it would do to the relationship of you not drinking but still being with the-these folks-- These friends?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;349;client;Yeah, I, uh--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;350;therapist;Would-would it work out and--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;351;client;I don't know. Just, it's weird, I-I think that, you know, kinda when I go there, you know, and-and hang with them at all, it's, uh-- You know, we- you know-;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;352;therapist;It's uncomfortable.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;353;client;Yeah. Yeah, exactly.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;354;therapist;What makes it uncomfortable?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;355;client;Well, 'cause they're drinking and then- and if I'm drinking soda, they kind of mess with me a little bit.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;356;therapist;How-- So, messing with you would be like what?;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;357;client;Well, they just mess with me until I get-- You know, until I drink a beer with them, you know. So--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;358;therapist;Oh, and-and-- Oh, I see, yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;359;client;You know, I mean, just-;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;360;therapist;Yeah, like sort of-;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;361;client;-they're just kinda like egging me on, I don't know.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;362;therapist;Oh, yeah, yeah.;other;;;

98;high;compliance with rules;364;therapist;Right, so you make--;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;365;client;I've been with them since, you know, like high school. So, I can't.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;366;therapist;Mm-hmm, and-;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;367;client;They mean a lot to me.;;sustain;;
98;high;compliance with rules;368;therapist;-it's [unintelligible 00:24:05]. I-I-I know that you, um- you value friendship and-and friendship is very important, uh, and, I'm just wondering how important, um, it would be for, uh, you to remain friends with them and still have your-your sobriety.;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;369;client;I guess maybe it would probably be not a bad idea to not hang with them for a little bit, I guess. You know, I mean, I-I-I-- Yeah.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;370;therapist;And see what happens.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;371;client;Yeah, sure. I gu- I think that would be something I could probably try.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;372;therapist;Yeah-yeah, how important would it- would it be? Zero being not so important and 10 being pretty important that you--;question;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;373;client;Well, if I need to get my license back, I think it would be pretty important for me to stop hanging around with them for a while, you know.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;374;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. [unintelligible 00:24:52] something you'd be willing to try. Okay.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;375;client;Yeah, absolutely.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;376;therapist;It sounds-- That sounds good.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;377;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;378;therapist;Well, maybe that's something that we could talk about next time if you- if you want to.;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;379;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;380;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;381;client;I think that would be a good idea. Uh, is this gonna help like get my license back, like, at this-- Like, the-the plans that I've made, is that gonna really help me like--;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;382;therapist;Well, I sure-sure would, um, tell the-the people who-who need to know-;therapist_input;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;383;client;Okay, good.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;384;client;-about the plans that you're striving for. Um, that I-- There would be, um, uh, someone to read this assessment-Mm.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;385;therapist;-and then, um- and then it would be up to you mostly. The choice is-is completely yours. And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this. You've given it a lot of thought, and you have some plans in place, and anyt;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;386;client;Um, probably just not really drink as much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have to really worry about that too much either.;;change;;
98;high;compliance with rules;387;therapist;Then you wouldn't have to worry.;reflection;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;388;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;389;therapist;Yeah, because worry's no fun.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;390;client;Yeah. This is true. Yeah.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;391;therapist;All right. Well, thank you Mike. I appreciate this.;other;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;392;client;Okay. Thank you.;;neutral;;
98;high;compliance with rules;393;therapist;Thank you.;other;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking.;question;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay, like what?;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.;reflection;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Does that sound realistic?;question;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah, uh, on the weekends?;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?;therapist_input;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-;;sustain;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.;;sustain;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep.;;sustain;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.;therapist_input;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.;;change;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.;therapist_input;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?;question;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five.;;change;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?;question;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five.;;change;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.;reflection;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yes.;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?;question;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.;;change;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?;question;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers.;;change;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?;therapist_input;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.;;change;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements.;therapist_input;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Thanks.;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going.;reflection;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay. Good.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;There, um, what brings you in today?;question;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;I don't know. I'm just having a little bit of, uh, having a little bit of trouble dealing with, uh, my criminal history and, uh, you know, trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, um, it's just- it gets, you know, it gets kind of overwhelming, you know. Um, I really wanna be, you know, a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, I got this background that nobody will overlook, you know. So it kinda makes it like, well, what, you know, do I go back to what I know?I mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating. It's causing, uh, some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, um, you know, and, um, I don't wanna fall back, you know.;;change;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you wanna be.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Yes, it is.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Yeah. So what-what-what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?;question;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;I don't know what about it is, um‚Äî;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?;question;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Yeah. It has a felony conviction on it.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Okay. Ah, there's-;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;And, uh‚Äî;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;the big trouble. Yeah.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;"Yeah, it is. And it's- I hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- You know, so at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail.""";;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;You know, and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering. You know, I mean, I think it would have been bad either way, but, um, I hadn't anticipated that this was gonna be this difficult, especially since I went back to school and, you know, uh, got a degree and actually want to do, you know, some, um, corporate level or, you know, professional type of work.;;sustain;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. So when you, um, when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. You're not even considered as an applicant?;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;No, I'm not. Um, in situations where I don't know about it, I don't know about, I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably-- Um, you know, that sucks too. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I-I don't- I don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;- I'm sure. The ones that really count are-are-are, you know, are kind of just, you know, uh, making me so angry and, you know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that I get face face, especially after a really good interview. And,;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;"Black and white. It just stops right there. ""I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I-- You have to go,"" you know, and it's‚Äî";;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;"No. I mean, there's different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say something like, you know, ""We'll discuss at interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I don't get a callback and those situations I don't know about. You know, but there are also times where I get an interview through, um, you know, uh, uh, some sort of connection or something, or like a buddy of mine or a family member will send me on an interview. You know, I don't have to fill it out- fill out an application for that. They just usually, you know, give you the interview. And at the end-";;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Seems like it's a done deal.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Yeah. It seems like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview. And then-;;neutral;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;You didn't hurt anything, right?;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;It's really frustrating because-;;neutral;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;I do, yeah.;;change;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Yeah. And, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?;therapist_input;;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;Well, it's-it's sucks either way. You know what I mean?;;neutral;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;50;client;-you know what I mean?

100;high;reducing recidivism;51;therapist;Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else.

100;high;reducing recidivism;52;client;Yeah, I think as far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, you know, but I had to tell you something, a lot of the people that don't care about that type of thing-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;53;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;71;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;72;client;I have done, and my eyes have, you know, just become like mush after all the reading I've done on this situation.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;73;therapist;What did you find out?;question;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;74;client;I found out that I have the type of, um, felony that's expungable, I don't even have the type that's sealable. I have apparently the type that has to go on the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or the candidates for, um, a gov- a governor's, uh, pardon. I-- That's what it all boils down to is that I have a class one felony-;;neutral;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;76;client;-that needs to be, if any, you know, options, the only option I have is for, um, governor's clemency and I can't figure out why because it's-it's, I mean, I just, I maybe there is a loophole somewhere, I don't know.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;77;therapist;I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a little bit about it, um, and not, yeah. So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;78;client;I've looked into, um, a fe- um, I've looked into a few groups that are supposedly helping convicted felons get-;;neutral;;

100;high;reducing recidivism;82;client;Um, again, the-the only-- I mean, I think what I saw was a whole bunch of, you know, dead end jobs.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;83;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;84;client;And the other thing that I saw was that it was very politically charged.

Um, I-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing to help, you know. And-and, uh, I saw that there was a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism but I would say a little bit of racial favor, I suppose. And, uh, I found it really hard to get in and to get an interview with a counselor to match me up with a job. Um, I think that those-those types of groups are cool if they work.

But if I'm not okay here, here, you know, I just, I don't think that I have, I don't stand a chance, you know?;;change;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;201;therapist;So the-the-the law of, um, felony convictions is-is something that you don't have any control over. I mean, nobody does. So, um, you know, and I'm thinking about how you were talking about getting all the way through the interview and then getting rejected, you know, versus being upfront about it and-and even on the telephone to see whether it's a deal breaker or not, because it must- it sounds like it's so much harder to have that good interview and walk out of there ad know you've done well, and then get turned down.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;202;client;Yeah. I mean, I just recently had one of those where I was gonna be offered. I- he-- I think he was-- I'm pretty sure he was offering him a really good job.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;203;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;204;client;And, uh, it was an interview given to me by my brother, you know, who knew the guy. And, um, it went great until he gave me the paperwork to sign for a background check. And I said, well, you know, I'll sign it, but I just wanna let you know that this is what you're gonna find.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;205;therapist;And your brother didn't know that when he gave you the lead on the job, that there was a background check involved?;question;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;206;client;No, he did. He said, you know, don't say anything until, you know-- I don't know if I know what he said. I think he said that he's not sure if they do.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;207;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;208;client;He said, just go ahead and give it a shot anyway, you know, and, um, I just, I figured I'd just give her a shot, but I think I like your, I think to spare myself some, uh, frustration and further agony-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;209;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;210;client;"-I think that I might try that. I think I might try, you know, from now on you know, uh, finding like a tactful way of asking, you know, I don't wanna be blunt about it and go you know, ""Do you hire criminals?"" or anything.";;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;211;therapist;You're not a criminal.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;212;client;I'm a former criminal though.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;213;therapist;That's right. You're rehabilitated.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;214;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;215;therapist;A plus shining new guy.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;216;client;Right. So, I know that I am a new guy, but, uh, they don't, you know, so I think society's a lot less forgiving.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;217;therapist;Oh, I think so, too.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;218;client;And individuals, and um, so I think I'm gonna try-- I think that's a really good idea is to kind of like weed out, you know, but how do you say that? You know. How-how do you possibly tell somebody, you know, how do you- how do you get that out there before you go in?;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;219;therapist;I guess I would just have a tendency to say it. I'm a recovering person, and back in my former life, I have a felony conviction. And before we go any further, I don't wanna waste your time. Uh, would that be a problem in even getting the interview, what would you think about saying something like that?;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;220;client;Hmm. Seems, uh, sort of forward, you know, but I-I think that it's probably better if I do tell them so I don't waste my time and hope.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;221;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;222;client;You know, yeah. I think I'm gonna try that from now on.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;223;therapist;Okay. I mean, I'd be happy if you wanna work on a few, you know, things, uh, to write down that sound comfy and fit, you know, how you talk and you use words and stuff. 'Cause I-I also think, you know, interviewing is a good schoo- a good skill, and the more you do it, the better you get at it. And you've been getting a lot of practice at it. So that's-that's been useful too.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;224;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;225;therapist;I mean, even-even though you get turned down, that feels terrible. The actual and, I bet you with every single one, you get better at it.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;226;client;Yeah. I mean the interview process-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;227;therapist;Uh-huh, uh-huh.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;228;client;-itself, no, I don't think I ever- yeah. No, I-I mean, I don't believe that I have a problem with the actual interview process.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;229;therapist;Yeah. I bet you're even better now.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;230;client;Yeah. It's been a lot.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;231;therapist;You got lots of practice.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;232;client;Been a lot, yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;233;therapist;Yeah. Well then lastly, just getting back, um, to this, another source that that same client was an advocacy group called the John Howard Society.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;234;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;235;therapist;I don't know if you've ever-;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;236;client;I have heard of it. I haven't-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;237;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;238;client;-looked into it yet, but-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;239;therapist;Uh, he, yeah, uh, he- they have a lot of, uh, they have a lot of really good stuff on there about this because they're trying to change the laws about that because-;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;240;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;241;therapist;-they are so, um, they are so prejudicial. They really are. And I would check with the ACLU too. I mean, just as I-I don't know much, and now I'm very curious and I wanna find out about it myself, but yeah.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;242;client;Yeah. I know. I-I've done some research on it for school.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;243;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;244;client;And, uh, it turns out it's a big cause of the recidivism rate. You know-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;245;therapist;Oh, absolutely.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;246;client;-as far as people going back-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;247;therapist;Absolutely.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;248;client;-to what they know, and, uh, and it's, uh, there is prejud- uh, prejudicial motivation, uh, and there is‚Äî;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;249;therapist;You're not allowed to vote.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;250;client;It's really frustrating. I know.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;251;therapist;And you're not allowed to vote.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;252;client;I think that- I think- I think ignorance is what really‚Äî;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;253;therapist;That shocked me when I found that out.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;254;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;255;therapist;I couldn't believe that.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;256;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;257;therapist;Do you know how many millions of people and when you think about that racially, um, hmm.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;258;client;Yeah, exactly.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;259;therapist;Yeah, mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;260;client;You know, I know there's-there's just a lot of- a lot of bullshit.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;261;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;262;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;263;therapist;That's a great word for it there. Yeah. So, um-;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;264;client;Yeah, to figure out [unintelligible 00:27:30] anyway, you know.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;265;therapist;Yeah. So-so maybe you- if you- if you wanted to, and this is really up to you, you could check out the blogs, you know. Um, I can see if I can track him down and stuff and the John Howard Society. And, um, I'd be really interested if-if you wanna get together to see what you have found out.;therapist_input;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;266;client;Yeah. I-I, you know, I, you know, like I said, I wanna make sure I come back and, um, kind of get my, um, you know, my overall mental health-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;267;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;268;client;-you know, um, I wouldn't say stable because I'm not that unstable. I just‚Äî;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;269;therapist;But this has affected it.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;270;client;It has affected it.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;271;therapist;Rejection-rejection, yeah.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;272;client;Yeah, rejection. Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;273;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;274;client;So, I just wanna make sure that I'm okay. So-;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;275;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;276;client;-I'll be back and we can, you know, we can discuss it further if you have any information and I'll share whatever I've got.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;277;therapist;I'll do some checking around for you. I will. Yeah.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;278;client;Well, thanks for the suggestions. Yeah.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;279;therapist;Oh, you are welcome. Thanks for being so open with me. I appreciate it.;reflection;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;280;client;No problem.;;neutral;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;281;therapist;Yeah. Okay.;other;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;282;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
102;low;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Liz. Well, thanks for meeting with me today.;other;;;
102;low;managing life;1;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
102;low;managing life;2;therapist;So what's something that you'd like to change or, um, work towards?;question;;;
102;low;managing life;3;client;Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start working out again. It's-it's been in my mind, I know I need to do it. It's just getting the motivation to do it.;;change;;
102;low;managing life;4;therapist;And you've been talking about that a lot lately. So I really-;reflection;;;
102;low;managing life;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
102;low;managing life;6;therapist;-feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy ab;therapist_input;;;
102;low;managing life;7;client;Well, I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it. I think it's just that I have a busy schedule.;;sustain;;
102;low;managing life;8;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
102;low;managing life;9;client;I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in.;;sustain;;
102;low;managing life;10;therapist;And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis.;therapist_input;;;
102;low;managing life;11;client;But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even. I mean, hour is a long time because if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-;;sustain;;
102;low;managing life;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
102;low;managing life;13;client;-time there, time back. I mean, it's not just an hour, it's like two hours, realistically.;;sustain;;
102;low;managing life;14;therapist;And it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in. And if it's gonna take you two hours, then it's gonna take you two hours. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need to start, and you need to start now.;therapist_input;;;
102;low;managing life;15;client;Well, oh, um, okay.;;change;;
102;low;managing life;16;therapist;All right. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be able to tell me that you went to the gym.;therapist_input;;;
102;low;managing life;17;client;Okay.;;change;;
102;low;managing life;18;therapist;Thanks.;other;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Before you go, do you mind if I take a look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?;therapist_input;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Great. So, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. How would you describe your drinking?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, I really only drink at parties. I don't drink at home or anything.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, liquor, whenever people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I don't like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;How much do you think you usually drink at a party?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;You mean the whole time I'm there?;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yes.;other;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Um, probably four or five drinks.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah. It makes me feel relaxed.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;What kind of things do you forget?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Um, I forget how many drinks I've had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Sometimes you forget where you're at.;reflection;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Right.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?;therapist_input;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?;reflection;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.;therapist_input;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.;;sustain;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.;;sustain;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Anything else?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;I really don't want any STDs.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?;reflection;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, a nine.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Great. Who could help you reach this goal?;question;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.;reflection;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.;;change;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?;reflection;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;. So, um, tell me about the exercise.;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Well, um, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;You have?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;I have.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;That's fantastic.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. I'm very pleased with it.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Um, I do feel better.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;My back‚Äî;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Your-- my what?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Wow.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I guess I need to build up to it.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Like last week, I-I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;so it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;I was kinda busy with some other things, but, um‚Äî;;neutral;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Mm-hmm. But you made it-- You made it one day-;reflection;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;I-I got‚Äî;;neutral;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;instead of zero days.;reflection;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;That's fantastic.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Yeah.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on.;reflection;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they are. And it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that.;;sustain;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;So you-you'd like to get buffed?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;No, but, um, when-when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-;reflection;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Yeah.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and‚Äî;reflection;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;35;client;It is.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;36;therapist;What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;37;client;Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more.;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;38;therapist;In what way have you gotten a little bit better?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;39;client;"Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,"" or some worthless thing like that I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it.";;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;40;therapist;So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?;question;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;41;client;Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;43;client;"-you know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."" Then-then that would be probably-- the-- that w";;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;44;therapist;Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy.;reflection;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;45;client;Right, decadent-- Why do they put the word decadent in food?;;change;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;46;therapist;'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely.;therapist_input;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;47;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;48;therapist;Yeah, yummy, so-;therapist_input;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;49;client;Okay. But it seems to be going so far so good. I-I guess, you know, I can like, you know, um, I-I'm-I'm pretty pleased with who-- how it's going on. Um, I'm really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time.;;change;;
106;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;That's really a big problem.;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?;question;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;7;client;I-I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just-- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?;therapist_input;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;9;client;No, but I don't smoke. I'm-- I-I-I've thought about quitting, but it's just- It's really hard so I just don't know how to do it.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;11;client;I know, I know. I've heard-- People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's-it's so hard.;;sustain;;
106;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call.;therapist_input;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;13;client;I just don't have time for any of that.;;sustain;;
106;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important.;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;15;client;I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;17;client;I don't know.;;neutral;;
106;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;19;client;I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those things and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it.;;change;;
106;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.;other;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;21;client;Okay, whatever. Okay.;;sustain;;
106;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
108;high;managing life;0;therapist;Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;1;client;Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;2;therapist;Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;4;therapist;So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;5;client;Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;6;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;8;therapist;Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;9;client;Yeah, exactly.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;11;client;Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;12;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
108;high;managing life;13;client;Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;14;therapist;Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;16;therapist;Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;18;therapist;Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability.;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;20;therapist;Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;21;client;I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;22;therapist;Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;23;client;Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;24;therapist;Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;26;therapist;Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;27;client;Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;28;therapist;Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;29;client;Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;30;therapist;Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;31;client;[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;32;therapist;Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;33;client;It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;34;therapist;Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;35;client;Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;37;client;I mean, I think so, yeah.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;38;therapist;All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;39;client;Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;40;therapist;Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;41;client;Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;42;therapist;Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;43;client;I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;44;therapist;Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?;therapist_input;;;
108;high;managing life;45;client;Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;46;therapist;Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?;question;;;
108;high;managing life;47;client;[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;48;therapist;Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;50;therapist;Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?;reflection;;;
108;high;managing life;51;client;Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;52;therapist;Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan.;question;;;
108;high;managing life;53;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;54;therapist;All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you.;other;;;
108;high;managing life;55;client;Thanks. All right.;;neutral;;
108;high;managing life;56;therapist;You're very welcome.;other;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities.;therapist_input;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Oh, great.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-;therapist_input;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;3;client;That sounds bad.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;7;client;But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them.;;sustain;;
109;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Oh, no. No.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.;;sustain;;
109;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.;;sustain;;
109;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Oh, yeah.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;27;client;"Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked ""No,"" because I never thought of myself as a smoker.";;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects.;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;29;client;I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So-;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;31;client;-I'm very concerned.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.;therapist_input;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Really?;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?;question;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?;reflection;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Um, I'd really like some more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new things that can be done to help people make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit.;;change;;
109;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.;therapist_input;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;43;client;That'd be wonderful. Thank you.;;neutral;;
109;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.;other;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Hi, are you Katie?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Hi, my name is Beth. I'm the nurse that works with the nurse practitioner Mrs. Smith that you just saw. Do you have a moment to talk?;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Uh, sure. What's this about?;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting to see Mrs. Smith, you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire-;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;and you answered some questions about your marijuana use. would it be Okay if I asked you some questions about how marijuana plays a role in your life?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Sure.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;I notice you use marijuana regularly, and I wanted to ask you more about that.;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;9;client;Well, you know they just decriminalized it in Virginia, it's not a big deal. I'm not in trouble, am I?;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;No. No, no, no. Not at all. Um, I just wanted to ask you how it helps you and how you use it. Can you tell me a little more about how you use it?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;11;client;It's not a big deal. It's just like a couple times a week to relax.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;Marijuana is really useful in your life in helping you relax?;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Yeah. I mean, I'm here on an academic scholarship so I have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team, so there's a lot going on.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;Mm. You're a very successful student and you have a lot of responsibilities, and it's really adding to your stress.;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Well, yeah. The truth is I'm the first in my family to go to college so I don't know, I guess, I'm in a bit over my head.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;Mm. You've been very successful academically and the transition to college has been hard for you.;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;17;client;I've always been an anxious person. Pot just helps me calm my nerves. I'm I in trouble?;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;I promise you, you're not in trouble, I wanna help.;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;Uh, tell me besides helping you relax, what are some positives about pot?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;20;client;Well, some of these kids are just so much more sophisticated than me so I guess when I party with them, I feel like I'm fitting in. I don't know how else to explain it.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;Hmm. Uh, when you use pot in a group you feel more at home with your peers and more accepted?;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;22;client;I don't know if I feel more accepted, more like I'm trying to fit in by using it.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;So how is it working to help you fit in?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;24;client;I'm not sure it is.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;Mm. So smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesn't seem to be making you feel more comfortable with your friends.;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;26;client;Uh, yeah.;;change;;
111;high;reducing drug use;27;therapist;What are some downsides to smoking pot?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;28;client;I don't know. I- It helps me relax but I guess I'm nervous I'll get caught. Um, my parents would kill me if they knew that I smoked.;;change;;
111;high;reducing drug use;29;therapist;So smoking pot doesn't help you feel more socially comfortable with your peers and it increases your stress because you're worried about your family and legal consequences?;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;30;client;Yeah.;;change;;
111;high;reducing drug use;31;therapist;Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;32;client;Well, I don't have the money for it. I just usually bum it off to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of spending money but I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to have to do that.;;change;;
111;high;reducing drug use;33;therapist;So smoking pot also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have extra cash to spend on things?;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;34;client;Yeah.;;change;;
111;high;reducing drug use;35;therapist;Katie, it sounds like smoking pot is helping you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you're worried about family disapproval. Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;36;client;I don't know. When you put it that way, it doesn't sound like a very good habit.;;change;;
111;high;reducing drug use;37;therapist;Would it be okay if I made a suggestion?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;38;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;39;therapist;You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever talked to a counselor about that?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;40;client;No. We don't do that kind of thing in my family.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;41;therapist;Can you tell me more?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;42;client;It's just not done. I don't know. It's something for crazy people and we definitely do not have the money for it.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;43;therapist;Mm. So the idea of counseling in your family is for crazy people only and it's looked down upon and the cost would cause a problem too?;reflection;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;44;client;Yeah. I just don't see it happening.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;45;therapist;Katie, we know that many kids come to college and have a lot of stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much better. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I'm wondering if you think it might be helpful for you?;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;46;client;I don't know.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;47;therapist;Can you describe why you're hesitant?;question;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;48;client;Well, I don't have the money for it so I can't pay for it and my parents wouldn't approve.;;sustain;;
111;high;reducing drug use;49;therapist;Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about- that your safety.;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;50;client;What, like suicidal?;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;51;therapist;Exactly.;other;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;52;client;Uh, I would never do that.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;53;therapist;Well, uh, we can go into some more specifics if you decide to see the counselor about what-what privacy rules there are, but for the most part, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with your parents.;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;54;client;Okay. I guess I'll think about it.;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;55;therapist;So, uh, if-if you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors.;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;56;client;Do I have to go there?;;neutral;;
111;high;reducing drug use;57;therapist;No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college.;therapist_input;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;58;client;Okay, sure. I agree, let's go.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.;therapist_input;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay, oh, actually, could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately. Well, prior to that party, like, as you know, I'm a honor student and my parents, like, they keep me very, like k-kept down out of the, like so- like social life.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, Oh, I'm always doing my homework, I'm always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on-- well, that party, I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house. So, that's when I started drinking.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;"It was a- it was a unique experience, as you can say. I guess you can say. And, I don't know, I-- It was fun, at least, in the moment. So, I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another party. And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, ""You drank vodka."" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I-I feel terrible because I-I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.";;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Right.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yes, right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;I haven't really-- I kind of just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- I was- I was instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can-- I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. I don't know it just‚Äî;;sustain;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Exactly.;;sustain;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Kind of.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;or any other things?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;So, that-that-that's also changed.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;A little bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of friends, and I would talk to another person that's an another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;So, since then, I've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;As they are there for me, you know.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Oh, um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this will happen.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;It's just up to me not to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I remember is the toilet-;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;-that's-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;But to me then it's a big thing.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Your mom is really important to you.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Of course.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;And how she feels about you is important to you.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Exactly.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;A lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;And also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;So I feel that there-there's a future in that.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;I'm pretty confident, especially.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Probably like an 8 or 9.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;And that can't be a ten there's nothing as ten in life I feel. Like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Because I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;It's not a pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's not worth drinking.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?;question;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;To make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get-get back my trust with mother-;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;-then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention but it's not. Hey guys.;;change;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.;reflection;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;And-and thank you for listening me listening to me. It means a lot to me.;;neutral;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.;therapist_input;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, Sandra.;other;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Hi.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;5;client;I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing.;;change;;
113;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her.;;change;;
113;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?;question;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;11;client;It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;What else? Tell me what else is good about it.;question;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?;question;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;19;client;That's true. Yeah.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Exactly.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking.;;change;;
113;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?;question;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke.;;change;;
113;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;29;client;I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan.;;change;;
113;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?;question;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;33;client;It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right.;;change;;
113;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?;question;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;35;client;I can't think of anything right now.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;37;client;I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about.;;sustain;;
113;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""";reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Exactly.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?;therapist_input;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk];other;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;43;client;We can talk about it some more.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?;therapist_input;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Okay, here you go.;other;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
113;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.;reflection;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;49;client;All right.;;neutral;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? And can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Uh, I guess that sound- that sounds right. I mean, I was- I was kinda drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just, I drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we drank a little bit more than usual. And I mean, at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride. So I-I just drove.;;neutral;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?;therapist_input;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah. That's-that's exactly how it happened. I mean, I'm a normal college kid. I like to drink and hanging out with my buddies. I mean, I, it wasn't a big house party or anything and I got busted.;;sustain;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.;reflection;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. I tried to be safe. I mean, I tried to call her roommate, but I don't know, getting in trouble anyways.;;neutral;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, well, I wanna say I have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem. I mean, my friends, they-they drink like fishes and I-- they don't ever get caught and you got me over here and I get caught and they left.;;sustain;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I guess- I guess more problems with police and school and I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that.;;sustain;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;How important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school, Dylan?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;God. It's, I guess, super important, because just-just going to detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- I don't want to do that again. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I have to go- I have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social life. I won't see any of my friends and I mean, it's already bad enough, like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI.;;change;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I guess I- I guess the easy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more-more likely to get in trouble. So probably I don't wanna drink so much.;;change;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Um, I guess I would say like, I don't know, like over halfway. So maybe like a six.;;neutral;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I could probably, um, I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like if I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking, like, I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do than just drink.;;change;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;In what ways might your life be better if you succeed in ;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;"Um, I mean, I guess the big one would be like I won't- I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8:00 AMs then, well, even-even when I make it to my 8:00 AMs now like I just, I sleep like I wake up I'm like, ""Oh my god what's going on?"" And then I get to my 8:00 AM and I'll just sleep through and then miss just about everything that's on the test. So I think if I- if I reprioritize what is important to me, I probably help me succeed. I mean, in high school, I had a 3.5 GPA. So I know I could do it here.";;change;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?;question;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I mean education is really important to me and-and also my family. My parents are always talking about it and I really- I really wanna be an international journalist, to be on the news like, I mean, I have the face for it, um. So I guess if I reprioritize my- if I reprioritize what I need to do I and I won't drink so much. I probably wouldn't be disappointing my parents and I'd be able to get a really good education.;;change;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.;therapist_input;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;All right, all right. When is the seminar?;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?;question;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And that feeling-;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;-and the color's okay? You know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking.;question;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Oh.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Possibly-;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;7;client;Gonna get that again.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;-coffee, tea. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure.;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;9;client;I do all the above, yeah.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;-um, healing-;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;in your mouth.;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;15;client;Okay. Sure.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So--;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;17;client;I've heard it all. I-- but I just want to get my teeth fixed.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Yes, and I really want to be helpful. I really want to-- you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, there are lots of medications out there, David, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. They're-- they make quitting so much easier.;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;19;client;I did a pill thing, so I did try it. So like, I did try try it. I just did the pills and they didn't work.;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;21;client;It was a waste and it caused more side effects;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;.No, it-- but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Or seven lectures along the road.;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what I meant. I--;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;25;client;No. No, I just feel that way. I get really-- I get very defensive about when they bring-- cause I get it from my family doc, from my cardiologist, everybody. I'm like, I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking, but‚Äî;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;27;client;-but it's not easy to quit.;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;28;therapist;No. But as I said, these medications-- so you've tried the medication, you've been willing once.;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Then, can I write you a prescription for the medication? Can we talk about how you could use it? Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health--;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;31;client;I guess I got to really want to and-- things I've tried usually caused me more problems than they helped.;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Oh no, the smoking's going to cause you more problems than the-- than anything else. I can promise you that, David.;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;33;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;34;therapist;The side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Like, that's the, I think, thing to really consider.;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;37;client;Okay. Well, can I go now?;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;38;therapist;I'm-- okay, but you know--;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;39;client;I-I-I know it, I know- I know, doc, what you're trying to-- but I just don't want to get into that right now.;;sustain;;
115;low;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay. Well thanks for listening, and honestly, I- I am really worried about the smoking, so--;therapist_input;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;41;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;42;therapist;I um--;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;43;client;I appreciate your care.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;44;therapist;I'm here to help, okay?;other;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;45;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
115;low;smoking cessation;46;therapist;So--;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;0;therapist;Molly, thank you so much for coming over and yakking with me today.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;1;client;You're welcome.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;2;therapist;Yeah, I appreciate it. So, um, uh, your mom had given me a call and said that, um, um, there were some problems with kids kinda given you problems at school and being mean and things like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thing.;therapist_input;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;3;client;Yeah. I stayed home two times already from school just 'cause of the bullying and everything.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;4;therapist;That's a- that's a lot of school to, yeah, and, you know--;therapist_input;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;5;client;And as I was out of school like more rumors started to happen as I was out of school. I come back and like these rumors are going around about me. Like one time when I stayed home, supposedly, I was in the principal's office the whole day and I had security guards like escort me to classes which that was not true 'cause I was home the whole time.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;6;therapist;People like to make up stories.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;7;client;I've been getting blamed ever since like fifth or sixth grade about with every single thing that's going on.;;sustain;;
116;high;addressing bullying;8;therapist;For, like why do you think, wh-what kinds of-;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;9;client;I think because the kids-- 'cause I like to nag on things. Like when people tell me things, I like to like talk more like with the person instead of just leaving it be, and I think the kids that like blame me for everything say that I'm an easy target to like hit, to like talk about, it's like annoying.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;10;therapist;So it's, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a little bit more about, can you give me an example of what you mean?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;11;client;"If somebody says like, ""Oh, I heard this thing about you."" I go, ""Oh, really, what is it,"" and I just keep talking and like make things worse. Like, if somebody says that they wanna beat me up, I like go on, and say like, ""Okay, then hit me,"" and like I just don't leave it be, like I just don't walk away. I like stay there and like talk more.";;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;12;therapist;And-and what happens when you don't leave it be, what usually happens?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;13;client;"I think possibly more like talking more like it gets like bigger and bigger. It's just like if you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they-they're like, ""Oh, like she's walking away."" And like that stops everything but like if I talk it-it keeps building up and we both get in trouble-";;sustain;;
116;high;addressing bullying;14;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;15;client;-and like called down to the principal's office.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;16;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;17;client;and get talked to.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;18;therapist;Okay, so and then what-what's it like for you after that, once you get spanked in the principal's office?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;19;client;Well, usually I try telling myself to just like, leave it be-;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;21;client;-but if somebody says something about me, it gets me mad 'cause like what the heck, like you're talking about me so like I try to stop but sometimes I just say like a few words. Like I think now I'm trying to get like better.;;sustain;;
116;high;addressing bullying;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;23;client;"Like there's this one incident that somebody was talking to me, I just said like, ""Oh, wow, this is like really lame, like I'm just gonna leave,"" and I like let the conversation be.";;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;24;therapist;That's pretty cool that you did that.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;25;client;Yeah. I felt proud of myself.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;26;therapist;You should be proud of yourself, and how did you do that?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;27;client;"I was just like thinking of like when I'm- whenever I like I'm saying like stuff back, mom gets really mad at me, she's like, ""Well, I'm not gonna help you anymore."" 'Cause, she tells me to like leave it be, but I really don't lis-listen to her so she gets mad. So I tried like thinking of like her feelings and like what would happen after if I say, ""This is lame, leave me alone,"" 'cause then they'll like stop and I won't get like yelled at anymore.";;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;28;therapist;Uh, that says a lot about you and your mom's relationship though that you can kind of put yourself in her head and think about how she would feel about it.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;29;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;30;therapist;You know what I mean? It's pretty cool, not everybody can do that, so. So you could kind of put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost like watching a movie ahead-;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;31;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;32;therapist;-and knowing how it's gonna turn out.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;33;client;'Cause usually, if I get in trouble, mom gives me the silent treatment that I don't like. It's like she doesn't talk to me, I'm like trying to talk to her, she don't like wheezing being like, uh, I don't like it.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;34;therapist;That's the worst, the silent treatment.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;35;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;36;therapist;Yeah, so, um, so but that worked for you, where you just let it go, you thought about your mom, you like what we would call like, you channeled to your mom, you know, and, uh, channeling mom, and then, um, you were able to walk away, and you were proud of yourself and nothing bad happened.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;37;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;38;therapist;Is that right?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;40;therapist;Does it--;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;41;client;Like they all like stopped talking to me, and the funny thing was that their eighth-graders that like didn't even go to my old school like I don't even know how they said of talking to me, I was like, creepy.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;42;therapist;Yeah, so- and so when you- when somebody else told you that they or people said you that you're an easy target, um.;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;43;client;Well, they don't really say that to me like I just like think that 'cause that's what I've like heard from my mom, and people talking to me 'cause I keep talking to them-;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;44;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;45;client;so they keep coming back at me.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;46;therapist;Okay, so they-they kinda know how to hook you.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;47;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;48;therapist;-and reel you in-;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;50;therapist;-right, and get you upset. And then bad things happen and then you get in trouble.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;51;client;Yeah. [chuckles] That happens a lot.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;52;therapist;Yeah. So, yeah. And it's, uh-- So, um-- so you-you know that when you're kind of channeling your mom, that helps. It sounds like you taught yourself almost. Like there's-;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;53;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;54;therapist;a conversation inside. What other ideas do you have about What you could do?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;55;client;I was thinking of like, um, if I'm like at school like a peep things are happening during class-;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;57;client;-I just say, can I use the washroom or something to go like walk and like think of like how to like leave them be. And one time during my gym class, there's this girl that I had her like not talking early. And we're playing pickleball, I don't know if you;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;58;therapist;I don't know what pickleball is.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;59;client;-it's like a badminton, big life-size ping pong ball game.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;60;therapist;It looks like a pickleball?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;61;client;Yeah, you have like a big bracket‚Äî;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;62;therapist;There's no pickle?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;63;client;No.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;64;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;65;client;No, [chuckles] there's no pick.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;66;therapist;I wanted to pickle and stuff.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;67;client;Mm-hmm. And like I was supposed to be like again turn. I told my-- I went to my gym teacher like silently and said I can't be by this person, can I move to the next court. So he like switched us around so I won't be by her. And that like happened.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;68;therapist;That's a really good decision.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;69;client;The girls like what the heck like.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;70;therapist;Yeah. No, but how smart on your part to know that if you would- if you would had to play with her, something bad would've happened.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;71;client;Yeah. Like I would like smacked her in the face or some- [laughs];;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;72;therapist;You knew that.;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;73;client;or something.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;74;therapist;Right? You knew that. So-;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;75;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;76;therapist;So you know actually which kids-;question;;;

116;high;addressing bullying;86;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;87;client;Yeah, it's kind of annoying, 'cause it's kind of hard like going into high school and like knowing how to believe and who not to believe.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;88;therapist;Yeah. That's-- that-- it's-it's really big unknown territory. Pressure High School class is probably 1,000 kids.;reflection;;;

116;high;addressing bullying;98;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;99;client;I was like really, you're probably just jealous 'cause I was friends with him or something.;;neutral;;

116;high;addressing bullying;105;client;I say the ones that like not even that I've known the longest, but like the ones that actually hang out with me a lot, or like texting me a lot, or like calling. And the ones that are actually like that helped you before with like situations. And that they tell you stuff and they know they can trust you. Like one of my friends tells me everything about her. And like that's how I know she's a good friend 'cause she trusts me with things.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;106;therapist;You trust her back then?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;107;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;108;therapist;Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense that people-- it goes both ways.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;109;client;Mm-hmm.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;110;therapist;You know. And, um-- So and for you, friends that, um, kind of, um, give you the attention that you'd like to have. Texting you-;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;111;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;112;therapist;-calling and you hanging out with you, and stuff like that, rather than pretending to be a friend-;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;113;client;Mm-hmm.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;114;therapist;-when you know maybe they're gonna--;reflection;;;

116;high;addressing bullying;116;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;117;client;And like she just starts like lying and like just talking smack about me. And it's like, you're not a good friend then. Like I thought you were a friend since you've been my friend since our fourth grade.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;118;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;119;client;And she just like causes a lot of drama now. And like she came- Like the friends I met at high school, she came like into them like, you're not gonna know-- In college, you're not gonna know who to follow 'cause-- since you keep following with my friends, what are you gonna do in college like not being able to find your own friends? It's kind of annoying 'cause they're my friends and like I can't be by her and she comes to my friends. It's like-;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;121;client;-get your own friends, [chuckles] stop following me.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;122;therapist;Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't you like about her?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;123;client;She just lies a lot and like just starts dramas about me and I haven't even talked to her like since eight grade. We only went to school together and she just like makes me lose other friends 'cause of the drama she starts;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;124;therapist;Okay. So she sounds like she's, um--;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;125;client;A nobody. I'm gonna say that. She's like‚Äî;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;126;therapist;Or-or not worth your time.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;127;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;128;therapist;She's not worth your time. So what would it be like for you to really just spend time with the friends that you know are really--;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;129;client;I do spend time with them. Like I hang out with them a lot.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;130;therapist;Good. That's really good. Yeah. And if-if you need like some extra support from them--;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;131;client;Ask for it. Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;132;therapist;Right, and what kind of things do you ask from them?;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;133;client;I just ask them like if I'm like gonna get like sent down to the principal's office for like something happening, I call them to come down to, like, support my, like, backup information.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;134;therapist;'Cause they can do that. They can- they can kinda give you some, uh, information like, uh, um-- they can give some accurate information, um, and back up your story versus the other person's story.;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;135;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;136;therapist;So, okay. So we're-- You know what? Um, it sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids-- actually, adults can be really mean too. But, um, I know in high school, i-it's really bad.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;137;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;138;therapist;So I'm wondering if, um, uh, if-if you wanted to, we could get together again and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some good ideas already. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring any of your good friends in, that that would also be totally cool too.;therapist_input;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;139;client;Yeah.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;140;therapist;So would that be something--;question;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;141;client;Yeah, there's one friend that might wanna like talk about it.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;142;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;143;client;And she's really like-- she doesn't know, like, who to talk 'cause her mom is not always there for her.;;change;;
116;high;addressing bullying;144;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;145;client;And so like she's like doesn't know where to go.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;146;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;147;client;Like she doesn't know who to believe.;;neutral;;

116;high;addressing bullying;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;152;therapist;It sounds like she really needs-- she'd like someone to listen to her.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;153;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;154;therapist;Yeah. So, um, we could maybe talk about some other ways of, um, helping, uh, deal with this because, um, it does sound like, um, people are, you know, just being plain old mean to you for no good darn reason.;reflection;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;155;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
116;high;addressing bullying;156;therapist;Yeah. And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then? Okay. All right.

119;high;managing life;8;therapist;Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;9;client;Um, it sits about at a 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it. So I really need to have a job and soon.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;10;therapist;Yeah. You're-you're-you're it.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;12;therapist;You have to provide for your children.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;14;therapist;Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;15;client;I mean, right now, I think I'm about at a three. I just seems like, you know, even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when I show up, I've got this resume that it's- it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job. So I just feel like I'm not, um, I don't know, that employable.;;sustain;;
119;high;managing life;16;therapist;So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;18;therapist;And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so great about your resume and your experience.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah. Yeah, because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now.;;sustain;;
119;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay. What is it that you- what is it that you want?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;21;client;I just want something that is- is gonna be steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where, um, I'm just making good money and- and I don't have to worry all the time about money.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;22;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah. It would be huge.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah. And it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;26;therapist;Right. So every day you know where you're going.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;28;therapist;Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;29;client;Right. Well, it would be good if I knew, you know, that my kids are taken care of too-;;change;;
119;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;31;client;- so I'm not worried about them while I'm at work.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;32;therapist;Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;33;client;Right.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;34;therapist;Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;35;client;Well, I mean, being able to make the interviews would be the priority.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay, Yeah.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;37;client;Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-;;change;;
119;high;managing life;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;39;client;- having someone I trust that I can call when I know I've got an interview.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;40;therapist;Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;41;client;Right. Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;42;therapist;So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would definitely help.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;44;therapist;What else would get you to a five?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;45;client;Um, I just wish that I had- I had more experience or, um, you know, more education. It seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;46;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;47;client;I get asked about education and training and ‚Äì;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;48;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;49;client;- um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I just feel just like I'm not good enough-;;sustain;;
119;high;managing life;50;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;51;client;- since I don't have that.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;52;therapist;Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;53;client;Yeah. Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;54;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any ideas as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;55;client;I mean, I guess, I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;56;therapist;Like what's going to be fastest.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;57;client;Right. I almost feel like that's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;58;therapist;Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;59;client;Yeah or something-- yeah, something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career just- just get me into something and then I can always focus on.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;60;therapist;Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;61;client;Yeah. Great. Exactly.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;62;therapist;But that would be steady and pays well?;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;63;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;64;therapist;Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;65;client;Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible for me. They seem like, you know-- seems like if-- maybe if I were better on the computer or you know.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;66;therapist;Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;67;client;Yeah. I think so- I think so because I don't-- I can't-- I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about‚Äî;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;68;therapist;The technology.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;70;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;72;therapist;Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;73;client;Yeah, that would be great.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;74;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;75;client;That would be great.;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;76;therapist;So what would you like to do next, you think?;question;;;
119;high;managing life;77;client;Well, find the childcare resources-;;change;;
119;high;managing life;78;therapist;Okay, okay.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;79;client;- is- seems to be- that seems to be the‚Äî;;neutral;;
119;high;managing life;80;therapist;That's a priority.;reflection;;;
119;high;managing life;81;client;The priority 'cause I can't even do an interview without that.;;change;;
119;high;managing life;82;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;83;client;And then, um, I mean-- I guess getting into some type of- some type of a training program that's, you know, short-;;change;;
119;high;managing life;84;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
119;high;managing life;85;client;- like maybe there's a weekend, I mean‚Äî;;neutral;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days.;other;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Oh, thanks so much doctor. I'll just take it easy for a couple of days.;;neutral;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?;question;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.;reflection;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just concerned about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.;;sustain;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?;;neutral;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day.;;sustain;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;I like to walk.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Me too. Walking is great exercise.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?;;sustain;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;That sounds great.;other;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Hmm. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym.;reflection;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Actually, I really would. I'm kind of excited about it. What else you got?;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Well, small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Mm-hmm. I can do that.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Diet, the D word.;;neutral;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Not necessarily. What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel good about.;therapist_input;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc.;;change;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;That's great. I'll see you soon;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Uh, welcome. And, uh‚Äî;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;1;client;Thank you.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;5;client;From my GP?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;From your GP, yeah.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;7;client;Uh.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;9;client;What's led me to come here?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;11;client;My GP.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;And what did he have to say?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;13;client;Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;15;client;And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;16;therapist;Right.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;17;client;Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;18;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;19;client;But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;20;therapist;Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;21;client;Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;22;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;23;client;But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;24;therapist;So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;26;therapist;"You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""";reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;27;client;Mm, I'm very surprised.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;28;therapist;Mm. Came out of the blue for you?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;29;client;Yes. I think it did.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;30;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;31;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;32;therapist;And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;33;client;I-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;34;therapist;-you've been-been overweight with it.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;35;client;That's what I understand.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;36;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;37;client;You know, and I'm not overweight.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;38;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;39;client;I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;40;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;41;client;I don't know, really.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;42;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;43;client;My lifestyle‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;44;therapist;Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;45;client;No.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;46;therapist;your lifestyle?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;47;client;No, not at all.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;48;therapist;Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;49;client;Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;50;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;51;client;-you know, why you are-- Look around you.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;52;therapist;Mm, mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;53;client;um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;54;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;55;client;Right?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;56;therapist;He's got a lot to do.;reflection;;;

121;high;diabetes management;58;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;59;client;He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.;;neutral;;

121;high;diabetes management;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;

121;high;diabetes management;109;client;Yeah, I guess.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;110;therapist;A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;111;client;Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;112;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;113;client;-I don't know how many years.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;114;therapist;Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;115;client;Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;116;therapist;Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;117;client;Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;118;therapist;That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;119;client;A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;120;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;121;client;-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;122;therapist;Correct. Yeah.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;123;client;Also, it's‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;124;therapist;But it's not inevitable.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;125;client;Right. Okay.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;126;therapist;Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;127;client;I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;128;therapist;Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;129;client;To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;130;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;131;client;Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;132;therapist;That makes a bit of sense.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;133;client;And why go any further, it's there?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;134;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;135;client;Can't help it.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;136;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;137;client;They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;138;therapist;They managed with it.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;139;client;Relatives relatively went into their 70s.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;140;therapist;Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;141;client;Well.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;142;therapist;If that would help.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;143;client;If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;144;therapist;Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;145;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;146;therapist;And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;147;client;I've heard of it yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;148;therapist;So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;149;client;Right.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;150;therapist;All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;151;client;Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;152;therapist;You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;153;client;Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;154;therapist;That's right.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;155;client;So insulin you-you.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;156;therapist;Kind of, as your.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;157;client;You have yourself draws bar.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;158;therapist;Yap.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;159;client;Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;160;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;161;client;Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;162;therapist;That's a good way to think.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;163;client;Is that what happened?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;164;therapist;Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;165;client;Why?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;166;therapist;And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;167;client;Right. Okay.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;168;therapist;Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;169;client;You mean, personally?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;170;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;171;client;Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;172;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;173;client;As you get older.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;174;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;175;client;I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;176;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;177;client;At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;178;therapist;A slightly more sedate lifestyle.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;179;client;Yeah, absolutely. You just do.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;180;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;181;client;You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;182;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;183;client;"Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?";;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;184;therapist;Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;185;client;Yeah, I mean.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;186;therapist;What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;187;client;Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;188;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;189;client;Um, I haven't noticed.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;190;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;191;client;I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;192;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;193;client;If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;194;therapist;So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;195;client;Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;196;therapist;Yeah, Mh-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;197;client;Um, more than I would normally.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;198;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;199;client;But that would be, that would be about it.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;200;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;201;client;Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;202;therapist;You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;203;client;Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;204;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;205;client;Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;206;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;207;client;Um.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;208;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;209;client;But maybe I-maybe I don't know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;210;therapist;Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;211;client;I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;212;therapist;Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;213;client;Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;214;therapist;From your perspective, things are going well?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;215;client;"My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.";;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;216;therapist;Yeah. It doesn't fit.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;217;client;And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;218;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;219;client;And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;220;therapist;Right.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;221;client;Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;222;therapist;Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;223;client;For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;224;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;225;client;Um.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;226;therapist;So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;227;client;Come on, you know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;228;therapist;And you know that's a bit too-;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;229;client;Well, life is too short.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;230;therapist;Too much.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;231;client;You know it's the truth.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;232;therapist;Yeah. Okay.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;233;client;I mean you know‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;234;therapist;And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;235;client;Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;236;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;237;client;And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;238;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;239;client;And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;240;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;241;client;Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;242;therapist;So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;243;client;Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;244;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;245;client;Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;246;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;247;client;And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;248;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;249;client;"You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""";;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;250;therapist;Hmm. Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;251;client;"And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;252;therapist;Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;253;client;Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;254;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;255;client;I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;256;therapist;And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;257;client;Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;258;therapist;Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;259;client;Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;260;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;261;client;Maybe I'm just‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;262;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;263;client;You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;264;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;265;client;And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;266;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;267;client;or Kentucky Fried or whatever.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;268;therapist;Very appealing, isn't it?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;269;client;You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;270;therapist;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;271;client;So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;272;therapist;Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;273;client;Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;274;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;275;client;for ages.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;276;therapist;They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;277;client;Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;278;therapist;So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;279;client;Well‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;280;therapist;-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;281;client;Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;282;therapist;Right.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;283;client;I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;284;therapist;You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;285;client;Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;286;therapist;You still run and have a cigarette?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;287;client;You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets‚Äî;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;288;therapist;Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;289;client;Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;290;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;291;client;That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;292;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;293;client;That was rugby and cricket was the same really.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;294;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;295;client;Um, but now‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;296;therapist;But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;297;client;"Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;298;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;299;client;But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;300;therapist;Okay, so you meant to reduce.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;301;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;302;therapist;You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;303;client;Yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;304;therapist;When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;305;client;Yeah, yeah. I sort of‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;306;therapist;So you've made our decision to do that?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;307;client;"it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.";;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;308;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;309;client;It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um‚Äî;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;310;therapist;Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;311;client;Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;312;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;313;client;You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;314;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;315;client;"So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;316;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;317;client;Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;318;therapist;But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;319;client;Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;320;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;321;client;So we cut that down as I say.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;322;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;323;client;But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;324;therapist;"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.";reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;325;client;"No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-";;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;326;therapist;MIT.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;327;client;-warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;328;therapist;Got to check out, why not?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;329;client;So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;330;therapist;Hmm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;331;client;"-and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as";;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;332;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;333;client;Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;334;therapist;So everything else looked pretty good?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;335;client;My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;336;therapist;Cholesterol good, your weight is good.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;337;client;Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;338;therapist;Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;339;client;Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;340;therapist;And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;341;client;Absolutely.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;342;therapist;So we're looking good.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;343;client;And then we come to this-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;344;therapist;And ah, hang on.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;345;client;-too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;346;therapist;Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;347;client;So, yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;348;therapist;And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;349;client;No.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;350;therapist;Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;351;client;I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;352;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;353;client;You shouldn't smoke.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;354;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;355;client;"And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""";;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;356;therapist;So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;357;client;You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;358;therapist;Mm-hm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;359;client;"And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.";;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;360;therapist;A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;361;client;Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;362;therapist;Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;363;client;No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;364;therapist;Feel like you need to. Yeah.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;365;client;I mean, it's you know, why?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;366;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;367;client;Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;368;therapist;The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;369;client;So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;370;therapist;I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;371;client;Is smoking related to diabetes then?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;372;therapist;It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;373;client;Oh.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;374;therapist;So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;375;client;Don't help.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;376;therapist;-isn't a good combination.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;377;client;Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs];;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;378;therapist;Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;379;client;Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;380;therapist;Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;381;client;I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;382;therapist;Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;383;client;Something of a rollover effect.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;384;therapist;-rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;385;client;Domino effect, yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;386;therapist;"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-";reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;387;client;I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;388;therapist;Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;389;client;Right.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;390;therapist;You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;391;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;392;therapist;So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;393;client;Okay, so‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;394;therapist;So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;395;client;So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;396;therapist;I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;397;client;Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;398;therapist;Apples for breakfast.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;399;client;You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;400;therapist;So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;401;client;Maybe.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;402;therapist;Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;403;client;Yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;404;therapist;And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;405;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;406;therapist;Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;407;client;Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;408;therapist;No.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;409;client;So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;410;therapist;Yeah? You like the social aspect?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;411;client;I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;412;therapist;No, no, I get that. I get that.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;413;client;-till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I‚Äî;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;414;therapist;So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;415;client;So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;416;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;417;client;You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;418;therapist;Haven't quite that-;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;419;client;And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;420;therapist;And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;421;client;And that gets me going. Yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;422;therapist;And the sugar in it helps too.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;423;client;Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;424;therapist;So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;425;client;Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;426;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;427;client;if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;428;therapist;And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;429;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;430;therapist;And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;431;client;Yeah, and then‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;432;therapist;You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;433;client;"And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;434;therapist;That sounds like a great plan.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;435;client;And so maybe that would, uh‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;436;therapist;Yeah, sounds like a good idea.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;437;client;Maybe it's an idea. I mean‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;438;therapist;I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;439;client;Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;440;therapist;Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;441;client;"Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;442;therapist;What's to lose? What's to gain?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;443;client;Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;444;therapist;It does make sense, yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;445;client;Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;446;therapist;So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;447;client;I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;448;therapist;Right.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;449;client;I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;450;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;451;client;Really.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;452;therapist;So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;453;client;Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;454;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;455;client;-and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;456;therapist;You've been stuck?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;457;client;I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;458;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;459;client;-which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;460;therapist;Indeed, yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;461;client;Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;462;therapist;So rather than--;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;463;client;"-because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""";;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;464;therapist;Carrying on.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;465;client;"""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.";;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;466;therapist;So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;467;client;Yeah, that's cool.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;468;therapist;Maybe this is the-;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;469;client;That's really cool.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;470;therapist;"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""";reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;471;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;472;therapist;"But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""";reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;473;client;Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;474;therapist;Things could be better?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;475;client;I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28];;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;476;therapist;Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;477;client;"I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go‚Äî";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;478;therapist;Quite invigorated with the idea of--;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;479;client;Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;480;therapist;Making some of these changes. Yeah.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;481;client;This is good. And, um‚Äî;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;482;therapist;You're up for the challenge?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;483;client;"I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?";;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;484;therapist;So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;485;client;Yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;486;therapist;"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""";question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;487;client;Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;488;therapist;Yeah, what-what would you be saying?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;489;client;observing as it were?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;490;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;491;client;Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;492;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;493;client;That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;494;therapist;And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;495;client;Yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;496;therapist;Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;497;client;I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;498;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;499;client;That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;500;therapist;"Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""";reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;501;client;Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;502;therapist;It's not about giving up your personality or-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;503;client;No.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;504;therapist;changing who you are fundamentally.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;505;client;No it's not. It's not.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;506;therapist;It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;507;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;508;therapist;It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;509;client;True, true.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;510;therapist;And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;511;client;Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;512;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;513;client;Maybe they were.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;514;therapist;And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;515;client;Yeah, you see‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;516;therapist;What you're kind of thinking about what those might.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;517;client;Mm. When your life comes to a halt-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;518;therapist;Mm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;519;client;-your family splits up, or whatever, and you don't have anymore, I-I think you stop caring really. Uh, y-you know, you stop caring about yourself;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;520;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;521;client;Because everything is just f-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;522;therapist;Nobody there too.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;523;client;Nobody there, [crosstalk] it's true and so,-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;524;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;525;client;-you know,-;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;526;therapist;Mhm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;527;client;-you don't care.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;528;therapist;So now it's time-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;529;client;So that's maybe [crosstalk];;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;530;therapist;to think about looking after yourself a bit more.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;531;client;Maybe, a bit selfish but maybe why not?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;532;therapist;Why not?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;533;client;Why not? Yeah, that's a good idea.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;534;therapist;Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;535;client;Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about. Now, you know, uh, okay, uh, coffee. Right? No sugar.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;536;therapist;You'll start with that?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;537;client;I'll start with that.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;538;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;539;client;Um, I'm gonna, um, I'll be talking to Bill, uh-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;540;therapist;The gym.;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;541;client;-about the gym but-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;542;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;543;client;-I like the idea of, actually again doing squash-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;544;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;545;client;-or something else-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;546;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;547;client;-and I'm gonna go down to the rugby club and I'll- I know that will be accepted. I'll offer my services again because-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;548;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;549;client;it was reasonably successful.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;550;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;551;client;And, uh‚Äî;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;552;therapist;And you also mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;553;client;"No, [crosstalk] oh, well, okay, yeah I didn't- yeah, I'll go back and say-- Well, look, I'd-I'd rather not go back to the doctor and say, ""I'm gonna do this, this, this-";;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;554;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;555;client;this and this.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;556;therapist;Mhm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;557;client;This is between you and me.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;558;therapist;Yep.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;559;client;All right?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;560;therapist;It's fine.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;561;client;But this is what I'm gonna do. All right? And like I said, I'm gonna make the inquiries, I will start there-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;562;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;563;client;-I will give up, uh, I'll give up the V drinks,-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;564;therapist;Mhm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;565;client;-I think, um, look for some better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I'd take an interest really.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;566;therapist;You are gonna make a start?;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;567;client;I'll take an interest really and-and, uh, but it is quite exciting, Mark.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;568;therapist;It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;569;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;570;therapist;-before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;571;client;Not too much.;;sustain;;
121;high;diabetes management;572;therapist;Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;573;client;Yeah, yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;574;therapist;-some of the things that have-;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;575;client;Just give me a bit of background, really.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;576;therapist;-around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;577;client;Oh, yeah, and what it is-;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;578;therapist;[unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;579;client;-because I don't really know. Yeah, yeah.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;580;therapist;Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;581;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;582;therapist;-see what sort of little changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-;reflection;;;
121;high;diabetes management;583;client;Wha-what are we talking about, sort of few months down the line?;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;584;therapist;It's really up to you. Probably a little bit sooner would be good.;therapist_input;;;
121;high;diabetes management;585;client;What, in about a month's time?;;neutral;;
121;high;diabetes management;586;therapist;That'd be great.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;587;client;Yeah, okay, I'm up for that.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;588;therapist;How does that sound?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;589;client;I'm up for that. Yeah, now-now that's putting me, um, that's very gently putting my head on the block;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;590;therapist;Because you don't know the timeline?;question;;;
121;high;diabetes management;591;client;-and I don't mind that because, um, yeah, that's cool.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;592;therapist;Mhm.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;593;client;Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a month.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;594;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;595;client;No worries.;;change;;
121;high;diabetes management;596;therapist;Excellent, excellent. Thanks, Mike. [croostalk];other;;;
121;high;diabetes management;597;client;And I appreciate it. Thank you.;;change;;
122;high;unidentifiable;0;client;Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here.;;sustain;;
122;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;2;client;I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever.;;sustain;;
122;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;Got it.;other;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Um, she-she found my stash-;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;6;client;-and she freaked out, and she's going crazy over it. Um, I don't why she was going through stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now I'm here.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;8;client;Um, I've been hanging out with a new cool crowd of people that I really like.;;sustain;;
122;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;10;client;Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;Yeah. So-so you've got this new group of friends and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this.;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;12;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;14;client;Yeah, basically.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;16;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;And, uh, sounds like you're-you're pretty upset with your mom for-for doing that?;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;18;client;I am.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;20;client;I mean, it's my stuff, I don't know why she's‚Äî;;sustain;;
122;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff.;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;22;client;I-I don't go- I don't go through her s- I don't go through her stuff. I don't go through her purse. I don't‚Äî;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;23;therapist;Yeah. So why should she go through yours?;reflection;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;24;client;Right.;;neutral;;
122;high;unidentifiable;25;therapist;Yeah. Yeah;other;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;1;client;That's great.;;neutral;;
123;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;3;client;I don't smoke cigarettes.;;neutral;;
123;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.;question;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges.;;neutral;;
123;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;7;client;And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it.;;sustain;;
123;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?;question;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;9;client;Really? Bad? But they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars.;;sustain;;
123;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out.;;sustain;;
123;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?;question;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I didn't really know I'd started.;;sustain;;
123;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;What do you mean?;question;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;15;client;I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.;;sustain;;
123;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So you're gonna quit then?;question;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;17;client;Uh, maybe.;;neutral;;
123;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, it's something that I'll have to think about.;;neutral;;
123;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;21;client;Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back.;;change;;
123;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real.;;sustain;;
123;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die.;therapist_input;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, it's something that I'll think about.;;neutral;;
123;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change.;therapist_input;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;0;client;The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.;;neutral;;
125;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?;reflection;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;2;client;Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.;;neutral;;
125;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?;reflection;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.;;neutral;;
125;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?;reflection;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;6;client;Well, what is normal for a baby this age?;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.;reflection;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;No, not really.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;No.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your doctor.;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;No, I guess not.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;All right. Great. Have a good day.;other;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;therapist;Hello, Kaylie. I see you're here to pick up a prescription today.;other;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;client;Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.;;neutral;;

126;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;client;No, not really.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;therapist;Okay. Well, you take this one once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;client;No.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;therapist;All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor.;other;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;client;Okay. Um, so why am I taking this medication?;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;19;therapist;It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;20;client;I guess not.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;21;therapist;All right. Great. Well, have a good afternoon.;other;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?;reflection;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;28;therapist;Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;29;client;Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.;;change;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;30;therapist;Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;All right. Do you have any children in your home?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;No.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;34;therapist;Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;35;client;He didn't mention anything about that.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;36;therapist;All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;37;therapist;Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;38;client;Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away.;;change;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;39;therapist;Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;40;client;Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;41;therapist;Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;42;therapist;Hello, Kaylie. I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new medication to pick up today. Called in by Dr. Ferris for cholesterol statin 20. Do you have a minute to talk about it? I want to make sure that you know how best to take this medicine and to answer any questions that you might have.;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;43;client;Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;44;therapist;All right. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;45;client;He told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol so that I should start taking this medication.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;46;therapist;All right, and he's right. This medication will help lower your cholesterol, and it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did the doctor tell you to take this medicine?;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;47;client;He didn't tell me, he just phoned it in.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;48;therapist;All right. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you usually take your medications?;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;49;client;I take all my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.;;change;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;50;therapist;That's perfect. This medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day.;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;51;therapist;Where do you store your medications?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;52;client;I store them all in the nightstand by my bed.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;53;therapist;Do you have children in your house?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;54;client;No. I don't have any kids.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;55;therapist;All right. So that sounds like a perfect place for you to store those. Medications are best when they're stored away from light, heat and moisture.;reflection;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;56;therapist;What did your doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;57;client;He didn't mention anything about that.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;58;therapist;All right. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, you should check with either Dr. Ferris or myself. And lastly, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice. So while you're taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit juice.;therapist_input;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;59;therapist;Just so we know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you are going to take this medicine?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;60;client;Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet of the cholesterol statin, uh, in the evening with all my other medications. And I guess I'll switch to orange juice. And if I notice any bad muscle pains, then I'll be sure to call Dr. Ferris right away.;;change;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;61;therapist;That's great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What questions do you still have for me?;question;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;62;client;I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.;;neutral;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;63;therapist;All right, good. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Good morning.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I need some medication if you can offer me some.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Absolutely, we're in the right place for that.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;5;client;And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop.;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;7;client;It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I'm getting sick of it. It's, you know, I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here.;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;9;client;Especially the other night I was at the restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit embarrassing I'm the only one walk walking out.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing.;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Any other reasons?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Um, it's expensive these days.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;How much does it actually cost you a week?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;15;client;It's-it's about-- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost ¬£7.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;¬£7 a week or a day?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;17;client;¬£7 a day today, so-;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;So your pack a day‚Äî;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;19;client;-you're talking about ¬£40, uh‚Äî;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;¬£50 a week.;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;21;client;¬£50 a week.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Even more mess, you see.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Okay. So we're talking about spending ¬£50 a week-;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons.;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;27;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Great, okay. So have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;31;client;Well, what you do-- What do you suggest?;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains.;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;33;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;34;therapist;What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;35;client;Um, it's just entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke-;;sustain;;
131;low;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;37;client;-or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;39;client;The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stresses.;;sustain;;
131;low;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;41;client;Just, uh, when I- when I go down, uh, for-for a break at work.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;43;client;I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. The cigarette just helps me calm down.;;sustain;;
131;low;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;45;client;It's definitely the one at the end of the evening.;;sustain;;
131;low;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Okay, so the end of the day-;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;48;therapist;-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time.;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;50;therapist;Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;51;client;I guess, um, I'll just- I'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, I don't know.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;53;client;It's one of those tough things.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Have you managed to stop smoking in the past?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;55;client;I've managed for a couple of weeks.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;56;therapist;Okay. And what got you back?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;57;client;It was, um-- To be honest, it was stress from an argument with my partner I remember.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;58;therapist;So something just happened-;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;60;therapist;-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the sm;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;61;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;62;therapist;The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a little stress that's going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with.;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;63;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;64;therapist;What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to choose to be your quit date?;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;65;client;I guess, um, at the weekend I've got a party coming up.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;66;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;67;client;So, uh, maybe Monday morning.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;68;therapist;So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP.;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;69;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;70;therapist;So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;71;client;Yeah. I'm thinking, um, one of these patches.;;change;;
131;low;smoking cessation;72;therapist;Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-;reflection;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;73;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;74;therapist;-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stop;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;75;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;76;therapist;You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a person who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one?;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;77;client;I just get irritable.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;78;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;79;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;80;therapist;And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you.;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;81;client;Hmm.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;82;therapist;So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week.;therapist_input;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;83;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;84;therapist;So, you're happy with the date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;85;client;Yeah, absolutely.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;86;therapist;Okay and would you like to come back and see me again?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;87;client;Well, definitely.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;88;therapist;And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?;question;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;89;client;A nice phone call.;;neutral;;
131;low;smoking cessation;90;therapist;I'd be very happy to do that.;therapist_input;;;
132;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hello, again, Mr. Green. It's really nice to see you again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. And as you know, there's all sorts of things can affect your health. So can we just have a bit of a general chat, but how are you getting on?;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;1;client;Well, I suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I've got to change my ways and give up the things I enjoy.;;sustain;;
132;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.;therapist_input;;;
132;high;diabetes management;3;client;The doc said I've got to take pills for the rest of my life.;;neutral;;
132;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;You don't seem too happy about that.;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;5;client;Well, I feel fine, but the-the doc said it could save my life.;;neutral;;
132;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.;therapist_input;;;
132;high;diabetes management;7;client;Okay, what should I do first?;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;9;client;Where do you think I should start?;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say.;therapist_input;;;
132;high;diabetes management;11;client;Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn‚Äôt you?;;neutral;;
132;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;13;client;Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.;;sustain;;
132;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;It‚Äôs really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;15;client;I really should do. Or shouldn't I,;;neutral;;
132;high;diabetes management;16;therapist;How important is it for you then to lose weight?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;17;client;Well, I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should,suppose I should be an example to them.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;18;therapist;So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;19;client;Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden to them.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;20;therapist;Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;21;client;Uh, I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;22;therapist;What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;23;client;You know, to start with, I could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;24;therapist;Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm.;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;25;client;In fact, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;26;therapist;So I think it should be really supportive of that then.;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;27;client;And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at works.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;28;therapist;So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;29;client;I'm gonna start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;30;therapist;Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;31;client;Well, there's one, one thing uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said that would help with my blood pressure.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;32;therapist;Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too.;therapist_input;;;
132;high;diabetes management;33;client;Well, I didn't know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;34;therapist;So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?;reflection;;;
132;high;diabetes management;35;client;I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better.;;change;;
132;high;diabetes management;36;therapist;That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?;question;;;
132;high;diabetes management;37;client;Yes, that‚Äôs fine with me.;;neutral;;
132;high;diabetes management;38;therapist;That‚Äôs great. All the very best then.;other;;;
132;high;diabetes management;39;client;Thanks. You too.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I‚Äî;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've‚Äî;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about‚Äî;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Yes.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;the expectation of life on the inside something?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Yeah, it's worse.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to‚Äî;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;I haven't yet, I mean-;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;-the, uh, the offer's there.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Uh, tell me-;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;-it's there.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;No.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;How long have I been out?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;Three weeks, one day.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Three weeks, isn't it?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Three weeks, one day.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;I don't know.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;No, never lasts.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;Yeah. And- [crosstalk];;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;50;therapist;Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;51;client;-sort of opposite, yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;52;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;53;client;You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;54;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;55;client;But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;56;therapist;Okay. Okay. So‚Äî;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;57;client;Do you have an idea?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;58;therapist;No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;59;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;60;therapist;But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;61;client;Fiona?;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;62;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;63;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;64;therapist;Tell me about Fiona?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;65;client;She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;66;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;67;client;something.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;68;therapist;Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;69;client;12 years.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;70;therapist;12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;71;client;Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;72;therapist;Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;73;client;It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;74;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;75;client;Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;76;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;77;client;I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;78;therapist;Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;79;client;Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;80;therapist;Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;81;client;She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;82;therapist;She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;83;client;The one that, you know‚Äî;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;84;therapist;Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;85;client;Yeah, that's the one.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;86;therapist;Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;87;client;No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;88;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;89;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;90;therapist;So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;91;client;If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;92;therapist;Sure, yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;93;client;And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;94;therapist;"All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?";question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;95;client;"I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?";;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;96;therapist;I know.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;97;client;Like if I'm not careful, I will be.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;98;therapist;Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;99;client;Yeah, certainly.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;100;therapist;Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;101;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;102;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;103;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;104;therapist;Yeah. And you're still with her?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;105;client;Yeah, yep.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;106;therapist;Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;107;client;You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;108;therapist;Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;109;client;A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;110;therapist;Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is‚Äî;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;111;client;No, they are.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;112;therapist;Oh, yeah? Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;113;client;I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;114;therapist;Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy‚Äî;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;115;client;Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;116;therapist;Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;117;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;118;therapist;It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;119;client;Yeah. No idea.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;120;therapist;No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;121;client;[nods].;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;122;therapist;"Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".";reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;123;client;Yeah. Well, um‚Äî;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;124;therapist;And now you've got‚Äî;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;125;client;Not many.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;126;therapist;Not many?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;127;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;128;therapist;But some.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;129;client;Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles];;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;130;therapist;One?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;131;client;One.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;132;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;133;client;Mm, yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;134;therapist;Yeah?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;135;client;Okay, so, um‚Äî;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;136;therapist;Tell me something about that.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;137;client;Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;138;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;139;client;So, he's the- he did it.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;140;therapist;He did it?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;141;client;I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;142;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;143;client;Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;144;therapist;Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;145;client;Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;146;therapist;No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-;therapist_input;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;147;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;148;therapist;to a transition about being in a different place.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;149;client;Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;150;therapist;Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;151;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;152;therapist;So that might work for him, but what might work for you?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;153;client;I don't know. That's why I'm here.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;154;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;155;client;I don't know what that is.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;156;therapist;Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-;therapist_input;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;157;client;Okay.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;158;therapist;thing. whatever it is.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;159;client;Good luck.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;160;therapist;Well, it's a search, isn't it?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;161;client;Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;162;therapist;No.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;163;client;-but I do mean it's a big ask.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;164;therapist;Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;165;client;Fucking guts.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;166;therapist;Guts? Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;167;client;Is it a quality?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;168;therapist;I think it is.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;169;client;Yeah, I'd need some of them.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;170;therapist;Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;171;client;Am I?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;172;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;173;client;No, not yet.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;174;therapist;Not yet?;question;;;

133;high;reducing recidivism;177;client;No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\;;sustain;;

133;high;reducing recidivism;180;therapist;-and-and-and you're talking about stuff.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;181;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;182;therapist;Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;183;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;184;therapist;-about stuff that's-that's quite deep-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;185;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;186;therapist;-in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;187;client;All right.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;188;therapist;In my view, it does.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;189;client;Okay.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;190;therapist;'Cause you could've come in here and said-;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;191;client;It's a bit awkward.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;192;therapist;"""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""";other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;193;client;Ah, yeah. I could've done that;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;194;therapist;You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;195;client;I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;196;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;197;client;I used to take the piss outta you guys-;;neutral;;

133;high;reducing recidivism;202;therapist;I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;203;client;Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;204;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;205;client;I just never did.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;206;therapist;Okay. So I'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;207;client;Do they?;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;208;therapist;They do.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;209;client;All right. Not to me.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;210;therapist;Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;211;client;Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;212;therapist;And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;213;client;Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;214;therapist;Sure, sure. You're in the system-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;215;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;216;therapist;-you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;217;client;The system?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;218;therapist;Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;219;client;Man, I've been fighting that system-;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;220;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;221;client;-and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;222;therapist;Okay, okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;223;client;-I mean‚Äî;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;224;therapist;So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;225;client;Well, I can't see it.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;226;therapist;You can't se it?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;227;client;You know what, if I knew what they'd look like-;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;228;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;229;client;-I-I might, you know, buy that.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;230;therapist;Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;231;client;Did I?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;232;therapist;Minimum wage-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;233;client;Oh yeah.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;234;therapist;-night shift, petrol station.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;235;client;Yeah, that's not much fun. That doesn't look very good.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;236;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;237;client;Yeah, that looks really hard.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;238;therapist;Yeah? It is really hard.;therapist_input;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;239;client;I know that's the right thing, uh, don't get me wrong.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;240;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;241;client;That is gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a dinner, looking after your kids. I mean, that is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;242;therapist;Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;243;client;I-- Hmm, maybe.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;244;therapist;Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um‚Äî;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;245;client;No. You know, convince me because, you know, I kind of want to be.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;246;therapist;Sure. Well, it's hard to me to convince you-;therapist_input;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;247;client;Right.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;248;therapist;-'cause this is your life and this is your story, and you-you've got to walk your life and I can't walk your life for you. I only walk my. And so, but I can walk with you on this life to try and think about-- 'Cause I-I-- You know, I-I've no interest in a;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;249;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;250;therapist;So it seems like what's gonna push in this direction, just tip that balance a little bit to give this other world of go? Because it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;251;client;It is the little things, yeah, like waking up, and having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind of cool.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;252;therapist;It's kind of cool?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;253;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;254;therapist;Not part of on the wire?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;255;client;No, you don't get to sit outside-;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;256;therapist;No?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;257;client;on the porch.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;258;therapist;You don't. And who's sitting on the porch with you?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;259;client;No one. It's morning, it's just me.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;260;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;261;client;Birds, trees, yada yada.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;262;therapist;Cool. So I'm picking up this world actually has the freedom to you to be your own man?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;263;client;Mm, you know, maybe.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;264;therapist;Maybe?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;265;client;I don't-- You know, that-that was nice. If it was full of bits like that, sure, but I mean, you know, eventually you have to go off to your job and-;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;266;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;267;client;-you know, pay your-your wages, I mean your-your mortgage and-and-;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;268;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;269;client;-it's just massive.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;270;therapist;Yeah it is. It is.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;271;client;It is.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;272;therapist;Absolutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you're up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause I'm hearing that‚Äî;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;273;client;You know, people like me are unaccepted into that world though. You know? I've got-- I don't have qualifications. All my mates are in Australia working awesome jobs, mining for 160K a year, you know? Just being men digging holes. Like, if I could do that, yeah, all good but fuck, I have just come out of prison, I don't have any NCEA. I, uh, I had one opportunity and I fucked that because I can't do night shift 'cause I'm lazy. You know? Maybe the world is giving me opportunities and I just don't need them. Maybe I can't do that.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;274;therapist;Sure. So what I'm hearing is, you're not convinced at the moment.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;275;client;No, I'm definitely not convinced.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;276;therapist;"No. So what would convince you to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you've done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not easy. You can't just wonder into a job, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me, pick me."" I know that.";question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;277;client;No.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;278;therapist;You know that.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;279;client;Yeah, I know.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;280;therapist;So, um-- And-and maybe it's about small steps and first steps.;therapist_input;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;281;client;Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is obviously, it is first steps, but I mean, what's that? What's the first step into the pro-social life?;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;282;therapist;Well, you trying to get a job, maybe and get into some routine.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;283;client;I just know if I get a job that I hate, I just won't do it.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;284;therapist;Okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;285;client;You know, I can make in an hour what I can make in a night or a week of nights. It's pretty-- You know, from where I'm from that a really-- You know, there's no decision at all, that's just like, what are you up to if you don't?;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;286;therapist;"Yeah. I'm confused though at the moment because you're saying, ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a week,"" but you've haven't. 22-22 days-";reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;287;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;288;therapist;-and you haven't done that. So-so tell me what that's about.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;289;client;"I just told myself I wouldn't this time and then Fiona said, ""You will not"" this time.";;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;290;therapist;So you told yourself you wouldn't, so you're once you- you're the sort of guy that once you make a decision you're gonna go, you're staunch with that decision?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;291;client;Yeah, even if it's the wrong one, yes.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;292;therapist;Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;293;client;Yeah, but I'm that kinda guy.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;294;therapist;Yeah, you're that kinda guy okay, so once you make a decision. So you made a decision that you're not gonna- you're not gonna go back to dealing?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;295;client;"Oh no there wasn't a decision to made, I just said, ""I won't yet"".";;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;296;therapist;Yet.;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;297;client;Yeah, I said yet.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;298;therapist;You're keeping the door open-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;299;client;Yeah.;;sustain;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;300;therapist;-at the moment, is what I'm picking up.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;301;client;I hate that.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;302;therapist;Yeah, okay, so that will be a call you-you've got to make.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;303;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;304;therapist;I'm-I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna make that call. You'll make that call, but there's a consequence of making that call, and there's big consequences more time probably and Fiona not being around. On the other hand, what I'm picking up is a call to-to do some- do some stuff that may not be racy and exciting and in the big dollars, but me being with Fiona and engaging in this transition into a-a different life.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;305;client;Mm, yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;306;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;307;client;And we're still no closer.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;308;therapist;No.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;309;client;But I mean yeah it's there.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;310;therapist;But we're talking about it.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;311;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;312;therapist;So how much time have you been talking about this-;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;313;client;Oh, fuck.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;314;therapist;position?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;315;client;With anyone other than Fiona? No time at all, I'd say for about 10 hours with you.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;316;therapist;Okay-okay, so the fact we're even having a conversation about it, it's kind of interesting?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;317;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;318;therapist;Yeah, so I wanna summarize, Daryl, what-what I picked up so far and then just so I make sure I'm really listening to you well 'cause it's important, isn't it? 'Cause, you know, it's important you're listened to-;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;319;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;320;therapist;-by people me. So what I'm picking up is-is-is that if you've-you've got this long 12-year history, you can make some big money or you can dealing, doing crime, that stuff, I'm-I'm picking up that Fiona's set the bottom line, is if you go back in that lif;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;321;client;Yeah, 12, nearly 13.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;322;therapist;Nearly 13 years, so and-and so-so she stuck with you, and I'm pick up that's important to you, um, and-and-and yet you talk about it, it just seems easy, this bit over here, this whole lifestyle.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;323;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;324;therapist;This other lifestyle over here though when we talk about, actually thinking about, you know, doing stuff, doing the stuff that-that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30] will gets on doing, it doesn't have that same kinda seem to excitement, and it doesn't seem to be a-a starting point for you over here.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;325;client;Uh, that it-it does kinda seem exciting.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;326;therapist;Oh, it does?;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;327;client;It does, because it's so different.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;328;therapist;Right, okay.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;329;client;And I'm kinda over that one.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;330;therapist;Okay, you're over that one, okay. So, let's start to think about what might be the first step.;therapist_input;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;331;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;332;therapist;Yeah, with while going in, I think you got a high steep.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;333;client;Okay, I.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;334;therapist;Yeah, a steep, you see before you had a mate who turned his back on offending.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;335;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;336;therapist;And for him this 12-- You wondered that the 12-step stuff working for him.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;337;client;Yeah-yeah, it does work for him.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;338;therapist;Yeah, maybe that, I'm wondering the conve- the conversation with him that might be around actually how did he do it, and how did he stay without slipping back across the line, 'cause like-like get this crossroads you've got the path and go the other path and go here, so I'm wondering about conversation with him, what would it take to have that conversation?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;339;client;Uh, ringing him.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;340;therapist;Ringing him?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;341;client;Mm, yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;342;therapist;Yeah. You seem a little surprised, I'm-I'm [crosstalk] wondering about, surprising face.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;343;client;You-you know, it was a long time ago that we were inside. I just know that's what he's doing. It would be pretty odd calling but the- he'd probably be okay with it.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;344;therapist;So possibility to call?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;345;client;Possibility to call yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;346;therapist;Yeah there's possible.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;347;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;348;therapist;Yeah, okay, and Fiona's been pretty staunch.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;349;client;Mm.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;350;therapist;Is someone who actually who has some pretty clear ideas about where she wants you as a couple to go-;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;351;client;Mm.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;352;therapist;I get a sense.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;353;client;Yeah.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;354;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;355;client;Well, I just have to do what I'm told. I don't know.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;356;therapist;Yeah, but I'm picking up though behind that doing what you're told, she's got some hopes.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;357;client;Oh, yeah, I was being, um, chipping, I mean, yeah she has more hopes than me, you know.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;358;therapist;So what will it take for you to start thinking about some of her hopes and sharing some of her hopes?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;359;client;Um, like I do- I do but what it would take, you know, I mean, that's pretty freaking scary shit.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;360;therapist;Yeah?;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;361;client;Yeah. And I would never admit to that.;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;362;therapist;You said before you're sort of guy that once you make a decision you're pretty staunch with that decision.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;363;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;364;therapist;So if you made a decision to go there, it might be a scary as shit but again it seems that, uh, it could work if see it look, this is important, this relationship's important, let me go for‚Äî;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;365;client;Yeah, but my-when I made my decision to not do that yet like I was very clear I understood I know that picture. If I'm gonna make a decision to do this, I kinda need to really-really know what that is. You know, not only to talk I mean-;;neutral;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;366;therapist;Sure.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;367;client;-what is the whole plan to-to call-call up you know and say, hey bro, hey bro, uh, how did you do that? I mean, really? Is it‚Äî;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;368;therapist;Yeah. That's-that's what I'm thinking- I'm thinking actually. Here's someone that actually has made a different decision then, uh, it sounds like that's the pathway that starts over here and I'm wondering. I wonder whether you might have wisdom about what it's like to t-to tread that path.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;369;client;Yeah, like, I guess I could be wondering that too.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;370;therapist;So you know there's a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work.;reflection;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;371;client;Hmm.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;372;therapist;And this is a pretty lonely road to-to walk by yourself. I'm wondering who else might be around you that might actually walk with you?;question;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;373;client;There's Fiona.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;374;therapist;Yeah.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;375;client;[unintelligible 00:26:37] getting out so what-what he did. Um, dad's only as mean. There's Fiona.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;376;therapist;You know maybe they'll walk that road with you too.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;377;client;Yeah, okay, uh, all right, yeah. All right.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;378;therapist;There's a couple of people.;other;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;379;client;Yeah.;;change;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;380;therapist;If you want to do that. It gotta be your call.;therapist_input;;;
